<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">D</span>INNER was coming to an end. The
Chinaman, soft-footed in his immaculate
white, had just finished his circuit of the table,
leaving a tiny gold-rimmed coffee-cup at each
of the four plates. Into hers Letitia was lowering
a lump of sugar, when a thought occurred
to her, and she dropped the sugar into the cup
with a little splash, and looking across at her
vis-Ã -vis, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, John, I&rsquo;ve been going to ask you half
a dozen of times, and have always forgotten:
did you know that Colonel Ramsay Reed had
a daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>To see the effect of her question, she stretched
forward a plump white hand and tilted to one
side one of the pink silk petticoats that veiled
the candle-flames. The obstruction removed,
she looked with vivacious interest at the person
to whom she had addressed her query. He, too,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>had just dropped his sugar into his coffee, and
was stirring it slowly, watching the little maelstrom
in the cup.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Ramsay Reed,&rdquo; he said, without
looking up. &ldquo;Yes, I think I&rsquo;ve heard something
about his having a daughter. But why
do you ask me? Isn&rsquo;t Maud a much better
person? She knows everything about everybody.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at his sister-in-law, the dark,
brown-eyed woman, very splendid in her white-and-yellow
dress, who sat at the head of the
small table. It was just a family party&mdash;Mr.
and Mrs. Mortimer Gault, Mrs. Mortimer&rsquo;s sister,
Letitia Mason, and Mortimer&rsquo;s brother,
John Gault. Mrs. Gault, who seemed to be
quite oblivious to the impertinence of her brother-in-law&rsquo;s
remark, answered smartly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised to hear that Colonel
Reed had daughters by the dozens. Who
knows really anything about those old bonanza
men who&rsquo;ve lost their bonanzas? They drop
out of sight, and nobody ever hears of them
again. Colonel Reed was in his glory before I
was born.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was a slight exaggeration. Mrs. Mortimer
Gault had been born a full thirty-eight
years ago, in a house which now has a bakery
beneath and furnished rooms above, in the environs
of North Beach. It was quite fitting
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>and proper that she should have first seen the
light there, as in that day North Beach was
fashionable. But that this should have occurred
thirty-eight years ago was a subject she
quietly ignored. She was still so effective in
her dark, quick-flashing style, so much admired
and so fond of being admired, that she turned
her back on and denied the thirty-eight years
whenever she had the chance.</p>

<p>Her husband looked at her with indulgent
and humorous appreciation of her quickness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, if Colonel Reed has a daughter,&rdquo;
he said, &ldquo;what he keeps her on. She can&rsquo;t live
on the memory of his bonanza glories. The
old fellow hasn&rsquo;t got a cent in the world.
White Pine scooped the last dollar he had.
When did his wife die?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia, who was twelve years her sister&rsquo;s
junior, and, even if she had not been, would
not have felt sensitive about her accumulating
birthdays, answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, long ago. Colonel Reed&rsquo;s always been
a widower ever since I can remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I remember hearing about his wife when I
was a boy,&rdquo; said Mortimer. &ldquo;She was a
young actress, and married the colonel when
everything was going his way. Then she died
in a year or two of consumption. I didn&rsquo;t
know there was a child.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be quite young, then,&rdquo; said Maud
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>Gault. &ldquo;What did you hear about her, Letitia?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing much; only that she was pretty,
and lived in an old ramshackle house somewhere
across town, and that nobody knows
anything about her. One of the girls was talking
about it the other day at Mamie Murray&rsquo;s
lunch, and I thought it was so funny, everybody
knowing about Colonel Reed, that he
should have had a daughter that none of us
had ever heard of. That&rsquo;s why I asked John.
He knows more of those queer, left-over people
than anybody else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She again tilted the candle-shade and looked
at John Gault. For the first time since the
conversation had turned on Colonel Reed&rsquo;s
daughter, he met her eyes. His were brown and
deep-set, and being near-sighted, he generally
wore a pince-nez. He had taken this off, and
looked at Letitia with his eyes narrowed to
mere slits, after the manner of short-sighted
people. Having finished his coffee, he was
leaning back, the candle-light striking a smooth
gleam from his broad expanse of shirt-bosom.
The restless fire of diamonds broke the glossy
surface, for John Gault, like many rich Californians
of a passing era, clung to the splendid
habits of the bonanza days. Sitting thus, he
looked a spare, muscular man verging on forty,
with dark hair and an iron-gray mustache.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know whether that&rsquo;s meant to be a
compliment,&rdquo; he said, with the lazy smile with
which he generally treated Letitia&rsquo;s sallies.
&ldquo;Have I got a larger collection of freaks than
most people?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did <i>you</i> hear about Colonel Reed&rsquo;s
daughter?&rdquo; asked Maud Gault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Really, I don&rsquo;t recollect anything in particular,&rdquo;
he said; &ldquo;probably just what Letitia heard&mdash;that
she was pretty and lived somewhere
across town.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If a man&rsquo;s going to remember everything
he hears about girls that are pretty and live
somewhere across town, he&rsquo;d have to get Professor
What&rsquo;s-his-name&rsquo;s Memory System down
by heart,&rdquo; said Mortimer, pushing back his
chair. &ldquo;Come, Maud, you don&rsquo;t want to sit
here all night, do you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They rose, and together, the rustling ladies
first, passed through the intervening hall into
the drawing-room beyond. It was a warm,
glossy, much-upholstered room, with an appearance
of overcrowded cheeriness. Lamps
casting halos of mellow light through beruffled
silk shades like huge primeval flowers, glowed
from the corners and sent glistening rays along
the leaves of tropical plants. The ornaments
disposed upon the tables and mantel-shelves
were numerous and interesting enough to have
claimed an afternoon&rsquo;s careful attention. There
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>were mounds of cushions on the divans, and
sudden prolongations of the surroundings in
unexpected mirrors. Framed in the folds of the
portiÃ¨res was the bright, distant picture of the
deserted dining-table, with its bloom of candles
and glint of glass and silver.</p>

<p>The small family party all knew one another
so well, and so constantly met for these little
informal dinners, that when John Gault excused
himself on the ground of an evening
engagement, no one criticized his defection or
urged him to stay. Letitia, who had put on her
new pink gauze dinner-dress that evening, was
more hurt by the fact that he did not comment
upon its splendors than that he left so early.
She was used to his unceremonious inclusion
of herself in the family party, whom he called
by their Christian names and treated with brotherly
informality.</p>

<p>This evening, as usual, she went into the
hall with him for a last word or two while he
put on his coat. Secretly she was hoping that
he would notice her dress; for if Letitia had a
weakness, it was for rich apparel. Fortunately
she could indulge it. She had a fair fortune in
her own right, and being an orphan who made
her home with her married sister, her income
was hers to spend as she pleased.</p>

<p>Standing under the hall light, she regarded
Gault with grave attention as he attempted,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>alone and unaided, to put on his coat. Then,
seeing the unequal nature of the struggle, she
said suddenly, &ldquo;Let me help you, John,&rdquo; and
taking the garment from him, shook it and held
it out to him by the collar.</p>

<p>He laughed, and thrusting an arm into the
sleeve, said over his shoulder:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re not only the most ornamental but
the most useful person I know, Letitia.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks,&rdquo; she responded sedately; &ldquo;but I
wouldn&rsquo;t have supposed you thought I was
so ornamental.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he answered, affecting as dramatic
a surprise as was possible in his position,
with his second arm just thrust into the
sleeve.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you never noticed me to-night at
all,&rdquo; said Letitia, giving the collar a settling
jerk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Never noticed you?&rdquo; He was able to turn
round on her now, and regarded her with exaggerated
astonishment. &ldquo;What do you mean?
I noticed you more than I did any one else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean myself, exactly; I meant
my gown.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That shows how a feeling silence is thrown
away on a woman. I noticed it a dozen times;
but just because I didn&rsquo;t say so you suppose
I was blind to it. How could I be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stepped back and looked critically at Le<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>titia
standing where the light of the hall lamp
fell softly over her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t be
strange for a man not to notice the dress, because
the person who has it on is so much
better worth looking at than any dress.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia&rsquo;s delight at this compliment could not
be disguised. She blushed and tried not to
smile, and looked as childishly pleased as a
woman can who is five feet nine inches high,
and has the massive proportions and noble outlines
of a Greek goddess.</p>

<p>She was, in truth, a fine creature, large, statuesque,
and handsome, as Californian women
are handsome, with the beauty of form and
color. Viewed critically, her features were not
without defects; but her figure was superb in
its type, her skin was flawless, and her naturally
rich coloring was still further intensified
by the reddish hue that had been imparted to
her hair by some artificial means. In the full
panoply of evening dress there was something
magnificently vivid, almost startling, about her.
One could imagine a stranger, who had come
suddenly upon her in a doorway or on a
staircase, standing mute, with caught breath,
staring.</p>

<p>To-night, touched into higher brilliancy by
the new pink dress, her beauty even struck
Gault&rsquo;s accustomed eye, and his compliment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>had more sincerity in it than is usually found
in those administered to relations. Then,
amused at her girlishly naÃ¯ve pleasure, he bade
her a laughing good night, and without waiting
for her response, opened the door and let himself
out.</p>

<p>The Mortimer Gaults lived in the newest and
most fashionable part of San Francisco. Two
years before they had leased one of the houses
that have sprung up, alone or in groups of
three or four, throughout that quarter of the
city where Pacific Avenue runs out along the
edges of the sand-hills. Here the undulating
lines of the great dunes, dreaming under the
ceaseless hush, hush, hush of the wind sweeping
through the rank sea-grass, have been hidden
under the march of progress. Large new
houses, shining with paint and bright with
window-boxes, have settled on the slopes, and
now hold the sand down. A layer of earth and
a hose have transformed the haggard face of
the dunes into gardens which would be a mass
of vegetation but for the French gardeners&rsquo;
restraining shears.</p>

<p>The house rented by the Gaults, a solid, pale-hued
building of the colonial form of architecture,
was large, new, and imposing. Flowers
drooped over its faÃ§ade from many window-boxes.
Its porch was verdurous with great
leafy plants growing in tubs and earthenware
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>pots. In the front there was a close-clipped
strip of lawn, with neat borders and a filamentosa
palm, and the lower part of the bulging
bay-window was hidden by the close, fine
foliage of an ivy geranium.</p>

<p>Faring down the street with a quick step,
John Gault passed many such dwellings, the
homes of the city&rsquo;s well-to-do and wealthy.
Here and there an undrawn blind afforded him
a glimpse of a glowing interior, where the tall,
shrouded lamp cast its light over a room as
gaily brilliant as the one he had just left. But
his eye traveled over the illuminated pane with
unseeing preoccupation. He walked rapidly,
and with the undeviating glance of inward reflection.
Once he stopped at a corner lamp
and looked at his watch. Then he hastened
his steps, and a few blocks farther on boarded
a cross-town car.</p>

<p>The part of the city toward which he was
going was of a very different aspect and period.
His car passed from the quiet gentility of the
West Side toward the hum and glare of the
business quarter. It swept him through streets
full of the rank and ugly sidewalk life of a
great city after dark to where Market Street,
the town&rsquo;s main artery, throbbed and roared
with the traffic of the night.</p>

<p>The line he had taken reached its terminus
here, and he alighted, made his way through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>the crowd and clangor of the wide thoroughfare,
and plunged into the streets beyond.</p>

<p>Here at once the wayfarer feels himself in a
locality whence prosperity and fashion have
withdrawn themselves. The ill-lit streets, the
small and squalid shops, the sordid faces of the
passers-by, tell their own tale of a region fallen
from grace. John Gault had too often passed
this way for the ruinous aspect of the surroundings
to possess any interest for him. With a
thin thread of cigarette smoke streaming out
above his upturned collar, he passed on rapidly
through the patches of shadow and garish light
from show-windows. People turned and looked
at him sharply, his noticeable figure being an
unusual one in that locality. To one watching
it might have seemed that this curiosity annoyed
him, for he quickened his pace, and at
the first side street turned off to the left.</p>

<p>There were fewer wayfarers here; the lamps
were far apart, and on either hand the dark
forms of huge houses, their faÃ§ades showing
only an occasional light in an upper window,
loomed vague and forbidding. The dreariness
of desertion seemed to hold them in a spell, as
they rose, brooding and black, from the dimness
of overgrown gardens. This had been one of
the great streets in San Francisco&rsquo;s splendid
heyday. Here millionairedom had built its
palaces and held its revels. John Gault remem<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>bered
some of them, and now his eye passed
blankly over the lines of darkened windows
and the wide porticos where years before, on
his vacations from college, he had entered as a
guest.</p>

<p>But his thoughts were elsewhere.</p>

<p>How strange that the conversation should
have taken that turn at dinner! Could Letitia
have heard anything? Impossible! Even if
she had, she was too simple-minded and direct
to be so man&oelig;uvering. This was the seventh
time he had been to see Viola Reed&mdash;the seventh
time in less than three months. What
did he go for? He laughed a little to himself
at the question, and throwing his head back,
blew a film of cigarette smoke into the night.
What did he go for? To pass the evenings,
that otherwise would have been idly passed in
his own rooms, or dully passed in society, or
drearily passed in the pursuit of amusements
he had long wearied of, in the society of a girl
who pleased his critical taste, beguiled him of
his boredom, and piqued his interest and curiosity.</p>

<p>Yes, that was the secret of her attraction for
him. She was not like any one he had ever
known before. She piqued his curiosity.</p>

<p>A picture of her rose before his mental vision,
and with a shamefaced laugh at his own sentiment,
he threw his cigarette away. Letitia
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>had said she was pretty. Undoubtedly she
was, but she was something more than pretty.
Refined, delicate, poetic&mdash;there was no word that
described it. If Letitia went about talking of
her, other people would want to see her. He
resented the idea violently, and felt his anger
rising at the thought of the coarse curiosity
and comment that would suddenly surround
her. Some one ought to stop Letitia from talking
that way.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For,&rdquo; thought John Gault, as he turned a
corner and came within view of Colonel Reed&rsquo;s
abode, &ldquo;I am the prince who has found the
Sleeping Beauty.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The house, like many in that quarter of the
city, was detached, and had once been a dwelling
with pretensions to gentility. Time and
weather had worked their will of it, and even
under the kindly veil of night its haggard dilapidation
was visible. It sat back a few feet
from the street in a square of garden, where a
tall dracÃ¦na shook its rustling foliage to every
breeze. There was a large flowering jasmine-tree
by the gate, that spread a sweet scent
through the noisome airs of that old and ill-drained
quarter. The visitor softly opened the
gate and entered up a pathway flagged with
squares of black-and-white stone that were
broken and uneven. From the front window&mdash;a
wide bay shrouded in vines&mdash;the light
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>squeezed in narrow slits. John Gault pulled
the old-fashioned bell and stood listening to its
jingling note.</p>

<p>There was a step in the passage within, and
the light shone through the two narrow panes
of glass that flanked the front door on either
side. A key turned and the door was opened.
In the aperture Viola Reed stood with a kerosene
lamp flickering in her hand. She held a
piece of light-colored material in the other
hand. As her glance fell on the visitor she
made an instinctive movement as if to hide
this.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, is it you?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Come in. I&rsquo;m
glad you&rsquo;ve come!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She uttered the sentences quickly, and was
evidently embarrassed. Even by the light of
the smoky lamp Gault could see that she had
flushed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never thought of your coming to-night,&rdquo;
she said, as she turned to open the parlor door.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a great surprise. My father will be
delighted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held the lamp up while the visitor divested
himself of his coat and hung it on the
chair that did duty as a hat-rack. In the dim
hallway, with its walls from which the paper
had peeled in long strips, and the stairway beyond,
with the twine showing through the
ragged carpet, the man of the world in his well-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>groomed,
well-dressed, complacent perfection
of finish, presented a curiously incongruous
appearance.</p>

<p>The girl opened the door, and he followed her
into the parlor. It was a long room, divided
in the middle by an archway, its lower end now
veiled in shadow. On a large table another lamp
glowed, a bunch of paper flowers hanging on
one side of the globe to subdue the light. The
room gave an impression of lofty emptiness.
The footsteps of the visitor seemed to be flung
back from its high, bare walls. The lamp
struck gleams of light from the gilded frame of
a large mirror over the chimney-piece, and here
and there caught the running gold arabesques
which covered the wall-paper. There were a
few wicker chairs drawn up to the table, which
was covered with the litter of amateur dressmaking.
In the single upholstered chair that
the room boasted sat Colonel Ramsay Reed.</p>

<p>With a loud exclamation of pleasure the
colonel rose and greeted his guest. He was a
remarkable-looking man of sixty-five or seventy,
fully six feet in height, erect, alert, with
a striking air of distinction in his narrow,
hawk-featured face, and a gaunt, angular figure.
His white hair flowed nearly to his shoulders,
and his white mustache was in singular contrast
to the brown and leathery surface of his
thin cheeks. He wore a long wrapper of inde<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>terminate
hue, patched with materials of different
colors and patterns, and a pair of old leather
slippers that slipped off his heels when he
walked. In his suave and urbane courtesy he
seemed to be serenely indifferent to the deficiencies
of his costume, folding his dressing-gown
round his legs as he subsided into his chair
with the deliberate ease that a Roman senator
might have displayed in the arrangement of
his toga of ceremony.</p>

<p>His daughter did not appear to share his composure;
she was nervous and embarrassed. She
swept off the evidences of her dressmaking with
a few rapid movements, and took them away
to the shadows of the far end of the room,
hung another paper flower over the blinding
glare of the second lamp, and, sitting by the
table, let her glance stray furtively about for further
details that needed correcting. John Gault,
who appeared to be awarding a polite attention
to the colonel&rsquo;s conversational amenities, was
conscious of her every movement.</p>

<p>Viola Reed was one of those women that nature
seems to have intended to make completely
and satisfyingly beautiful, the intention having
been changed only at the last moment. The
upper half of her head was without a fault&mdash;the
low forehead, the wonderful hair, thick and
wavy, and so instinct with life that every separate
filament seemed to stand out from its fel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span>lows,
in color a warm, bright blond, and with
shorter hairs about the ears and temples which
curled up in golden threads. In strange contrast
with this brilliant hair were level, dark-brown
eyebrows, that were low over large gray
eyes. She had the same dark-brown lashes,
which grew wide apart and turned back, a rare
beauty, and one which imparts an expression
of soft, wistful tenderness to the eyes thus
encircled.</p>

<p>Here Viola&rsquo;s beauty ended. Her other features
were, at least, inoffensive. She was tall
and beautifully formed, but in the slenderest
mold. To the Californian ideal she was thin.
But her movements were distinguished by a
supple grace denied to women of a more stately
build and proportion. To-night she wore a
shirt-waist, washed out from its original pink
to a wan flesh-color, and a scanty black stuff
skirt, belted with a black ribbon. Gault, with
his eyes fixed on the colonel, was aware of the
stealthy rearrangement she made of the ribbon
round her neck, and the movements of the investigating
hand with which she pushed back
her loosened hair-pins.</p>

<p>As was her custom, she made little attempt
to join in the conversation. The evening settled
down into a replica of its predecessors.
The fact that Gault was becoming a familiar
figure in the bare front parlor did not seem to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span>abate the colonel&rsquo;s buoyant appreciation of him
as a good listener.</p>

<p>The younger man, with his glance on the
floor and an expression of polite attention on
his face, found himself wondering, with inward
amusement, what his friends would say if they
could have had a glimpse of him, listening,
silently and submissively, to the reminiscences
of Colonel Ramsay Reed. The conjecture called
up such a picture of incredulous astonishment
and disbelief that a smile broke out on his lips.
Aware of its incongruity, he stole a quick, apprehensive
look at Viola. She was watching
him with a surprise evidently tempered by
pain at the thought that his amusement might
be evoked by her father&rsquo;s garrulity. Gault&rsquo;s
gravity became intense, and the colonel, who
was too engrossed in the joy of having secured
a victim to notice anything, went gaily on.
He was launched on his favorite subject&mdash;the
men he had assisted to affluence in the early
days.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Jerry McCormick. You know
where he is now? No need to ask any one
that; has been a member of Congress, can draw
his check for a million, his wife a leader of society,
and his daughters marrying English lords.
You know them, of course?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor made an affirmative sign, and
the colonel continued:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I made that man. When I first ran
against McCormick he was working in the
mines up in Tuolumne, with the water squelching
in his boots. In those days a dollar to
Jerry looked about as big as a cart-wheel. His
wife was glad enough to do a little washing,
and his daughter&mdash;the youngest ones weren&rsquo;t
born then, but the eldest, the one that married
the English lord, was&mdash;used to run round barefoot,
and bring her father his dinner in a tin
pail.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure she doesn&rsquo;t know what a tin pail
is now,&rdquo; said Gault, a mental picture rising in
his mind of the magnificent Lady Courtley as
he had seen her on her last visit to her parents.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said the old man; &ldquo;I hear she&rsquo;s one
of the Vere de Veres. And I can remember
her, a little freckled-faced kid with her hair
in her eyes, hanging round the tunnel of the
Little Bertha, waiting to give her father his
dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you know the younger McCormick girls,
Miss Reed? Lady Courtley was before your
time,&rdquo; said Gault, in an attempt to draw Viola
into the conversation.</p>

<p>She looked surprised, and then gave a little
laugh and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve never even seen them,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they don&rsquo;t know Viola,&rdquo; said the colonel&mdash;not
with bitterness, but as one who states a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>simple and natural fact; &ldquo;the old woman&rsquo;s
educated them out of all that. But, as I was
saying, I made their father. He&rsquo;d managed to
scrape together a little pile, put it all in a small
prospect, and lost every nickel. He was just
about dead broke, and came to me crying&mdash;yes,
crying&mdash;and said, &lsquo;Colonel Reed, there&rsquo;s only
one man in California whose advice I&rsquo;d follow
and whose opinion I&rsquo;d trust.&rsquo; &lsquo;Who&rsquo;s that?&rsquo;
said I, intending to help the poor devil to the
best of my ability. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s Ramsay Reed,&rsquo; said
he. &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said I, &lsquo;if you&rsquo;ll just put yourself
in my hands, and do what I tell you, I&rsquo;ll set
you on your feet.&rsquo; &lsquo;Colonel,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;say the
word, and whatever it is, it goes. You&rsquo;ve got
more financial ability in your little finger than
all the rest of &rsquo;em have in their whole bodies.&rsquo;
So I took him in hand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel paused, a reflective smile wrinkling
the skin at the corners of his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You certainly seem to have made a success
of his case,&rdquo; said Gault, feeling that some comment
was expected of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, yes,&rdquo; said the colonel; &ldquo;I may say a
great success. The poor fellow&rsquo;s confidence in
me made me determined to do my best. I used
to give him points&mdash;those were the days when
I could give points. Told him if he would follow
the lead west of the Little Bertha&mdash;people
had hardly heard of the Little Bertha then&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>he&rsquo;d
strike it. He was broke, and I gave him
the money. Three months later he&rsquo;d struck
pay dirt. That was the beginning of the Alcade
Mine, but he didn&rsquo;t have sense enough to
hold on to it, and sold out for a few thousands.
I saw then that I&rsquo;d have to do more than give
him an occasional boost, and stood behind him,
off and on, for years. Even when we ran into
the Virginia City boom he never bought without
my advice. He hadn&rsquo;t any discrimination.
I&rsquo;d just say to him, &lsquo;Save your money and buy
five feet next to the Best and Belcher,&rsquo; and
he&rsquo;d do what I said every time. Without me
he&rsquo;d have been working in the mines in Tuolumne
yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In the absorption of his recollections the
colonel crossed his knees, bringing one foot,
with a torn slipper dropping from the heel, into
a position of prominence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, those were days worth living in!&rdquo; he
said, running a long, spare hand through his
hair&mdash;&ldquo;great days! Men that weren&rsquo;t grown
then don&rsquo;t know what life is. I meet Jerry
sometimes, but we don&rsquo;t talk much about old
times. He knows that he owes everything to
me, and it goes against the grain for him to
acknowledge it. I hear his daughters are
handsome girls.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps&mdash;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; said Gault, recalling
the occasions when he had sat next to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>the Miss McCormicks at dinners, and suffered
exceedingly in the effort known as &ldquo;making
conversation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I heard that they were fine, handsome girls,
large, and with black hair like their mother.
She was a beauty in her day&mdash;a hot-tempered
Irish girl that Jerry married from the wash-tub.
The youngest daughter is about Viola&rsquo;s
age&mdash;twenty-three.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Gault turned and looked at Viola with
some surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You thought I was younger, didn&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
she said, smiling. &ldquo;Everybody does.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was about to answer when the colonel
once more took up the thread of his reminiscences.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Maroney was down then&mdash;&rsquo;way down; not
even on the lowest rung of the ladder&mdash;he
wasn&rsquo;t on the ladder at all. I gave him the
first lift he had. No one would look at Maroney
in those days. He was a thin, consumptive-looking
fellow, full of crazy schemes, forever
coming to you and borrowing money for
some wild-cat stock that wasn&rsquo;t worth the
paper it was printed on. I took a fancy to
him, and every dollar he made was through my
help and advice. It was when I had my offices
on Montgomery Street, and he&rsquo;d have a way
of dropping in about lunch-time and hanging
round looking poor and sick. I used to take him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span>out to lunch, and give him a square meal and
a few points that he&rsquo;d sense enough to follow.
He wasn&rsquo;t like Jerry; he was smart. Why, I
almost fed that man for years. When he&rsquo;d
get down on his luck&mdash;and he was always
doing that&mdash;I&rsquo;d say, &lsquo;You know, when you
want, my check-book&rsquo;s at your disposal.&rsquo; And
it was, more times than I can remember.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel paused, smiling at his thoughts.
The visitor, who had been looking idly on the
ground, raised his eyes and let them dwell in
curious scrutiny upon the old man&rsquo;s profile, cut
like a cameo against the dim walls with their
fine gold traceries. John Gault, like all Californians,
knew every vicissitude in the life of
Adolphus Maroney, one of the great bonanza
kings, a man whose career was quoted as an
example of what could be done by brains and
energy in the California of the Comstock era.</p>

<p>Wondering, as he had done many times
before, what Viola thought of her father&rsquo;s
vainglorious imaginings, he turned now and
suddenly looked at her. She was sitting with
her elbow on the table and her chin resting in
the palm of her hand. Her eyes were on the
colonel, and her expression was one of appreciative
interest. It was possible that she believed
in him, absolutely and unquestionably. Yet
her face, in its placid, restful gravity, gave no
clue to the thoughts within. She was not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>be read by every casual comer. Even the
practised eye of the man of much worldly
experience was baffled by the quiet reserve
of this young girl who was nearly half his
age.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t seen Maroney for nearly eight
or nine years,&rdquo; continued the colonel. &ldquo;The
last time it was in the lobby of the Palace. He
was with some capitalists from England, with
a millionaire or two from New York thrown in.
He saw me and looked uncomfortable, but he
shook hands and introduced me. I got away
as quickly as I could. I didn&rsquo;t want to embarrass
him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should you embarrass him?&rdquo; asked
Viola.</p>

<p>The colonel looked at Gault, and gave the
forbearing laugh of the man who treats with
good-humored tolerance the ignorance of the
woman.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, he was always uneasy for fear I&rsquo;d
give away the fact that it was I who made his
money for him. But, God bless my soul!&rdquo; said
the old man, throwing back his head and going
off into a sonorous laugh, &ldquo;he needn&rsquo;t be
afraid. I wouldn&rsquo;t rob him of any of his
glory. Only I took it pretty hard, when Mrs.
Maroney was here last winter, that she didn&rsquo;t
go out of her way to be kind to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola gave a little exclamation, Gault could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>not make out whether of annoyance or protest.
That the colonel should have expected his
daughter to be the object of Mrs. Maroney&rsquo;s
attention and patronage was only another evidence
of his painful self-delusion. Mrs. Maroney
was a lady who aspired to storm the
fashionable citadels of New York and London,
and troubled herself little with those of whom
she could make no practical use in the campaign.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re unjust to Mrs. Maroney,&rdquo; Viola
said gently, and rather weariedly, the visitor
thought; &ldquo;she was only here for two months,
and she had quantities of friends to see and
people to entertain.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my dear, my dear,&rdquo; answered the old
man, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s just your amiable way of looking
at it. She was like her husband&mdash;she wanted
to forget.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned his eyes, still bright under their
thick white brows, upon the younger man, and
looking at him with an expression of mingled
pride and patience, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That is the way with the Californians.
Once fall, and the procession passes you, and
the men that were beside you don&rsquo;t wait to
turn and see where you dropped. You stay
where you fall and you watch the others sweep
on. That&rsquo;s what I have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk that way, father,&rdquo; said Viola;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>&ldquo;Mr. Gault will think you feel unhappy about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man smiled, and leaning forward,
clasped her hand and held it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. Gault,&rdquo; he said, with quite a grand air,
&ldquo;knows better than that. The opinions of
other people don&rsquo;t affect our happiness. I don&rsquo;t
resent the prosperity of my old mates, nor feel
any discouragement at our present&mdash;er&mdash;temporary
embarrassments.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola stirred uneasily, and said quickly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no; of course not. Why should you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Gault rose here, and she rose, too. Her
embarrassment, which had vanished during the
evening&rsquo;s conversation, now returned, and she
plucked nervously at the paper flower on the
lamp-globe. It seemed to him that she was
anxious for him to go.</p>

<p>With the colonel it was otherwise. Rising
and standing upright in the patched limpness
of his dressing-gown, he affected incredulity at
the thought that his guest contemplated such
an early departure. Then, being politely assured
that this was unavoidable, and that, for
the matter of that, it was now close upon
eleven, he urged him to repeat the visit at an
early date.</p>

<p>&ldquo;We are always here, Viola and I,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We have not many engagements, as you see&mdash;just
a friend here and there. But we value
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>our friends more highly than the people do who
count them by dozens.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had followed John Gault out into the
hall, and from here his voice called:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The lamp, Viola. Mr. Gault can&rsquo;t put on
his overcoat in the dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came out quickly, carrying the smaller of
the two lamps, divested once more of its paper flower
shade. To give a better light she held
it up and looked at him, smiling a little from
under the halo made by her hair. In answer
to his good night she gave him her hand, which
he pressed with a warm, strong grip.</p>

<p>As he went down the few steps from the
porch the colonel stood in the doorway, his
figure in sharp silhouette against the light
within.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be a month finding your way down
here again,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;People say it&rsquo;s out of
the beaten tracks, but we prefer it to any
other locality in the city. Viola and I like the
old associations, and I&rsquo;ve struck my roots here
too deep to have them pulled up. Well, good
night! So long!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door closed, and as John Gault opened
the gate, the light vanished from the two long
panes of glass that edged it on both sides, and
gleamed out through the cracks and crevices
between the blinds of the bay-window.</p>

<p>It was a warm night, soft and still, and Gault
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>decided to walk. With his head bent down he
walked slowly, striking the cracks in the pavement
with the tip of his cane. From small
gardens still tended and watered in this unkempt
wilderness of brick and stucco, whiffs of
delicate fragrance drifted out across the pavements,
only to be stifled by the sickly odors
that rose from the open sewer-mouths.</p>

<p>When he turned into the wide avenues where
the old mansions stood, the air was fresher and
the silence heavier. Desertion and darkness
seemed to claim as their own this relic of a life
that had already passed away. The dim, bulky
shapes of the great houses stood back from the
street, sullen, black, and morose, like the visions
in a dream. Vines shrouded their solemn
forms, and here and there clung to the support
of an iron balcony-rail, hanging down in the
darkness like a veil that swayed and whispered
in the breeze. In one porch a hall lamp was
lit, and cast a pale and faltering light over an
entrance that looked as full of menace and
evil mystery as the opening to some bandit&rsquo;s
cavern.</p>

<p>But Gault passed their iron gates, high between
supporting pillars, without looking up.
A man&rsquo;s dreams held him in a trance-like reverie.
A man&rsquo;s perplexities destroyed the content
of many serenely selfish years. He had
come to what seemed to him the fateful mo<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span>ment
of his destiny. Had he been a younger
man he would have said with a rush of reckless
ecstasy, &ldquo;I love her!&rdquo; Now, walking slowly
home under the solemn stars, he queried to
himself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Shall I let myself love her? Do I dare?&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="II">II</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">L</span>ETITIA&rsquo;S surprise at the discovery that
Colonel Reed had an unknown daughter
was an unconscious compliment to the prominence
and conspicuousness still enjoyed by
that gentleman.</p>

<p>Hundreds of men who had made their fortunes
in the great days of the Comstock, and
lost them in the depression that followed, had
daughters and sons that the friends of their
prosperity neither knew nor cared about. The
Californian is shy of all sad, unsuccessful things.
Failures in the race in which so many won a
prize were quickly forgotten, and crept away to
hide their chagrin in distant quarters of the
city or in the smaller towns. The procession
had passed them by, and men who had been
underlings when they were kings reigned in
their stead. Even their names were no longer
heard, and their children grew up separated by
the chasm of poverty and obscurity from the
children of their old mates.</p>

<p>That Colonel Reed had not been overlooked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>was partly accidental and partly owing to his
inability to realize that such a state of affairs
could be anything but a public misfortune.
The colonel had the distinction of having collapsed
in a most tremendous and complete
manner, and he was proud of it. His case was
quoted to inquiring tourist and ambitious native
as a star example of money-getting and
money-losing in the State of California. His
passage from affluence to poverty was still a
story worth telling and hearing. It was all in
the superlative degree, for the colonel had
never done anything by halves. His prosperity
had been as extravagantly splendid as his
adversity was characteristically complete.</p>

<p>He had made the bulk of his fortune in those
years of the fat kine from 1870 to 1875. Before
that he had been well-to-do, as every man
could be in the San Francisco that developed
between the days when &ldquo;the water came up to
Montgomery Street&rdquo; and the inauguration of
the Comstock boom. He had been a figure in
the city from the earliest times, had known
San Francisco when it was a straggling line of
houses edging the muddy shores of the bay,
with a trail winding through the chaparral over
the dunes to the Mission Dolores. He had
climbed the lupine-covered slopes of what is now
California Street, and looked down on the hundreds
of deserted ships that lay rotting in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>cove. He had seen the city of tents swept by
fire, and the city of wood follow it in a few
months. He had been one of those who had
held a ticket for the Jenny Lind Theater on the
night it was burned down. He had witnessed
the trial of Jansen&rsquo;s assailants, and had served
on the two great Vigilance Committees, and
from the windows of Fort Gunnybags had
seen Casey and Cora go to their last accounts.</p>

<p>Of his journey across the isthmus in &rsquo;49 he
could tell thrilling stories. Only those of iron
physique and reckless courage had the hardihood
to accomplish the trip. The weak in
health and feeble in spirit were left behind at
the ChÃ¡gres or turned back at Panama. The
fittest survived to become those giants of the
far West, the California pioneers. Of these
the colonel had been a leading figure. Blood
ran red in the veins in those days, and ginger
was hot in the mouth. The present was too
full and tumultuous to allow of even the briefest
glimpse of the future. He became a part of
the seething life of the city, felt its heart-beats
as his own, lived greatly as it lived, loved,
hated, sinned, and rejoiced with it.</p>

<p>He often said afterward that at this period
of his life money was his last consideration.
There was too much outside to make the
question of sordid gain an engrossing one.
The pecuniary side of things was never one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>that had bothered the colonel much. And, true
to the old adage, Fortune knocked at the door
of him who seemed most indifferent to her.
His riches came suddenly. It was toward the
seventies, when the Comstock was pouring its
streams of wealth into hundreds of purses.
The colonel held his open and it was filled. It
was dazzling, wonderful, bewildering. His fortune
rose by bounds that he could hardly
follow. The figures of it seemed to grow overnight.
In the wild exhilaration of the period
he pressed his luck with unvarying success. He
became intoxicated, the fever of money-getting
seized him, and he believed equally in his star as
a man of destiny and his genius as a financier.</p>

<p>Such a sudden and unexpected rise to opulence
might have dazed another man, but the
colonel rose to it like a race-horse to the spur.
He was born with a natural instinct for luxury.
Formerly he had been merely one of a thousand
good fellows. Now he became a prince.
Nothing was too whimsically extravagant for the
pioneer who had crossed the isthmus in 1849.
He could be traced by the trail of squandered
money. He bought a country place near San
Mateo, raised a palace on it, and entertained
such celebrities as then drifted to California in
a way that made them tell astonishing stories
of the &ldquo;Arabian Nights&rdquo; existence of the bonanza
kings. In the heyday of his prosperity
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>he had married a young actress, who had enjoyed
the splendors of her sudden elevation for
three years, and had then died, leaving her
husband but one legacy&mdash;a baby daughter.</p>

<p>Very shortly after her death the colonel&rsquo;s fortunes
began to decline. He put on a bold front
and was more lavish in his expenditures than
ever, for his belief in himself was unshakable.
Then stories of his reverses got abroad, and
people said the whole brief span of his glory had
been a piece of pure and unmerited luck; as a
financier he had no ability. The misfortune
which attended all his later investments seemed
to prove this assertion. His money melted like
wax before fire. He bought largely of land
about South Park and Rincon Hill when it was
at its highest, refused to sell out, and saw the
tide of popularity move to the other side of
the city, leaving him overweighted with real
estate upon which he could not pay the taxes.
He mortgaged it to its full value, speculated
with the money, and lost it. Ten years after
his wife&rsquo;s death he was ruined. Twenty years
after saw him living in the house near South
Park, the sole possession left him.</p>

<p>The colonel took his defeat bravely. He held
his head as high as ever and accepted patronage
from no man. When some one suggested
that he should apply for aid to the Society of
Pioneers he looked as haughtily amazed as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>though they had told him to stand and beg on
the corner of Kearney and Sutter streets. Fate
had forced him into the little house on the far
side of town, but that was no reason why he
should remain hidden there. Nearly every day
he could be seen striding down Montgomery
Street and mingling with the world of men
where he had once been a leading figure. He
seemed to feel no shame on the score of his old
clothes turning green about the shoulders, and
greeted his comrades, now lords of the street,
with a cheery word and a wave of his hand to
his hat-brim.</p>

<p>He always had a busy air as of the man of
affairs. Men who did not know him well wondered
what scheme he had on hand that caused
him so much hurry and preoccupation. But
there was no scheme. It was only the colonel&rsquo;s
way of defying destiny and satisfying the thirst
and longing for the old excitement that carried
him back to the scenes of his triumphs. He
hung round Pine Street a good deal, telling
those who would listen to him stories of the
early days&mdash;of the men he had made, and of
the women who had been the reigning beauties.
Sometimes he was accorded an amused attention,
for he could be excellent company when
he chose, and many of his stories of the ups
and downs of 1868 and 1870 had become classics.</p>

<p>There was just one subject upon which, in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span>his Montgomery Street peregrinations, he preserved
silence. This was his daughter. He
said to himself, with a sudden squaring of his
gaunt shoulders, that he only mentioned her
to his intimates, and as his intimates existed
mainly in his own imagination, Viola Reed&rsquo;s
name was almost unknown.</p>

<p>John Gault, who belonged to a later era of
California&rsquo;s prosperity than the colonel, had
heard that there was such a person, but had
never seen her. He did not fraternize with the
old man, whom he regarded as a painful landmark
in the city&rsquo;s record of blighted hopes and
ruined careers. Like many of his kind, he had
an intense, selfish dislike for all that played
upon his sympathies or moved him to an
uncomfortable and discomposing pity.</p>

<p>One afternoon in the past winter he had gone
across town to South Park to see some houses
left him by his father, for which he had received
a reasonable offer. On the way home,
passing through one of the small cross-streets
that connect the larger thoroughfares, he had
encountered Colonel Reed and a lady. He
would have passed them with the ordinary
salutation, had not the lady, who had been
gazing into the wayside gardens, turned her
head as he approached and looked indifferently
at him with what he thought were the most
beautiful eyes he had ever seen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span></p>

<p>He stopped and greeted the colonel with the
polite friendliness to be expected of wayfarers
who encounter one another in such distant
localities. The colonel, who was always childishly
flattered by the notice of well-known men,
was expansive, and, after a few moments of
casual talk, introduced the younger man to his
daughter. Then they walked together to the
old man&rsquo;s house, which was some little distance
away. The colonel, stopping at the gate, invited
the stranger in. John Gault noticed that
the girl did not second the invitation, and excused
himself on the ground of pressing business.
But the colonel, who had never got over
the hospitable habits of his <i>beaux jours</i>, urged
him to come some evening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; said the old man, smiling proudly
on his daughter, &ldquo;will be glad to see you, too.
She&rsquo;s the housewife&mdash;runs everything, myself
included.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Thus appealed to, she added her invitation
to her father&rsquo;s, and Gault said he would come.</p>

<p>As he walked away, he wondered if she
wanted him to come. It had seemed to him as
if she had spoken under pressure and reluctantly,
though she had been perfectly polite.
But it was impossible to tell what a woman
thought, or when she was pleased or displeased,
and the next week he went.</p>

<p>Three months had passed since then. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>visit had been repeated many times, each time
under almost exactly similar circumstances.
Evening after evening Gault had listened to
the colonel, wondering why he came, why he
subjected himself to this absurd imposition,
why he sat meek and generally mute under
the conversational assaults of the garrulous
old man. And yet, the day after his seventh
visit, he sat in his private office wondering
how soon he could go again to the little house
near South Park without causing surprise to
its inmates or breaking the rules of conventionality
and deliberation that governed his life.</p>

<p>In the midst of his cogitations the door was
opened by one of his clerks, who acquainted
him with the fact that Colonel Reed was without
and wanted to see him.</p>

<p>The announcement came upon him so unexpectedly
that his color rose, and it was with an
effort that he composed his face to greet the visitor.
A disturbing presentiment of something
unpleasant seized upon him. Never before had
Colonel Reed entered or suggested entering his
office. &ldquo;What does the old man want?&rdquo; he
thought testily, as he bade the clerk show him in.</p>

<p>A moment later the colonel entered. He
was suave and smiling. There was nothing
of the broken financier, the ruined millionaire,
in his buoyant and almost patronizing
manner. His old black coat, faded and many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>years behind the mode, but well brushed and
carefully mended, was buttoned up closely, and
still sat upon his thin but sinewy figure with
something of its old-time elegance. In one
hand he carried a little black lacquer cane.</p>

<p>Sitting down opposite John Gault, where
the light of the long window fell full upon
his face, he had all the assurance of manner
of a man whose bonanza has not become a
memory and a dream.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going by, and I thought I&rsquo;d drop in
and pass the time of day,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Things
aren&rsquo;t as lively with me just now as they have
been. It&rsquo;s an off season.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s that with most of us,&rdquo; said the other,
regarding him intently and wondering what he
had come for.</p>

<p>&ldquo;All in the same coffin, are we?&rdquo; said the
colonel, airily. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m generally on the full
jump down here of a morning; but lately&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He shrugged his shoulders and flung out his
hands with a gesture of hopeless acquiescence
in unmerited bad luck.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re fortunate,&rdquo; said Gault, &ldquo;to have
something to be on the full jump about. We
find things pretty slow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, of course, in comparison with the past,&rdquo;
assented the old man. &ldquo;Slow? Slow is not the
word. Dead, my dear friend! San Francisco is
a dead city&mdash;dead as Pompeii.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, not quite as bad as that,&rdquo; said Gault,
laughing in spite of himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How should you be able to judge?&rdquo; retorted
the colonel. &ldquo;You weren&rsquo;t thought of when
we old fellows were laying out the town. There
was more life here in a minute then than there
is now in a week. Then Portsmouth Square
was the plaza and the center of the city,
with a line of French boot-blacks along the
lower side. We used to try our French on &rsquo;em
every time we got a shine. And Lord! what
smart fellows they were, and how much money
they made!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I&rsquo;ve heard,&rdquo; murmured Gault.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when I think of this street later on,
this street alone, in, say, &rsquo;70&mdash;how it boiled
and bubbled and sizzled with life! Those were
the days to live in!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Undoubtedly,&rdquo; acquiesced the listener. He
was afraid the colonel had only come to continue
the reminiscences on the historic ground
of his early gains and losses, and he ran over
in his mind the excuses he could use to politely
and speedily get rid of the old man.</p>

<p>But the colonel, it appeared, had another end
in view.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t find, however,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;that
my full-jumping pays very well. I&rsquo;ve got the
energy and the savvy, but the luck isn&rsquo;t with
me. And I&rsquo;m too old a Californian not to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[Pg 41]</a></span>know there&rsquo;s no good bucking against bad
luck.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused and tapped with the tip of his
cane against the side of the desk, evidently expecting
his companion to speak. This time,
however, Gault vouchsafed no reply, but sat
looking at him with a steady and somewhat
frowning intentness.</p>

<p>The colonel continued, nothing abashed:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve run into bad luck belts before, but
never as wide a one as this. It&rsquo;s about the
biggest I&rsquo;ve struck yet, and I&rsquo;ve had some experience.
Not that it&rsquo;s knocked me out,&rdquo; he
said, looking up and speaking with quick,
genuine earnestness&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t imagine that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing is farther from my mind,&rdquo; said
Gault; for the old man&rsquo;s look demanded an
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;For an old-timer like me, privations, misfortunes,
poverty, don&rsquo;t matter. We pioneers who
came round the isthmus and across the plains
aren&rsquo;t afraid of a little more roughing it to finish
up on. A day without dinner don&rsquo;t frighten
us, and we don&rsquo;t put our fingers in our mouths
and cry because we haven&rsquo;t got sheets to our
beds or fires in our stoves. But when you&rsquo;ve
women in your corral it&rsquo;s different&mdash;especially
women that haven&rsquo;t always seen the rough
side of things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course it makes a difference,&rdquo; the other
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>said, to fill up the colonel&rsquo;s second and more
persistent pause.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s how it is with me. If it was
only myself I&rsquo;d not think twice of it. But
I have to consider my daughter. It&rsquo;s not
the same with her. During her childhood she
had every luxury, but lately I&rsquo;ve not been
able to give her all that I&rsquo;d like to, though, of
course, she&rsquo;s never really suffered. And just
now my affairs are in such a devil of a tangle
that&mdash;well, I was going to ask you if you could
oblige me with a temporary loan&mdash;just a trifle
to tide us over this spell of bad weather&mdash;say
fifty dollars.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel looked into the younger man&rsquo;s
face quite unembarrassed, his old countenance
still preserving its expression of debonair self-satisfaction.
The money in his hand, he gave
it a slight clink, and then dropped it into a
worn leather purse with a clasp that snapped,
and said gaily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;This is the best medicine for low spirits.
Not that mine are low&mdash;no, sir; it takes more
than a temporary shortness of funds to knock
out a pioneer of &rsquo;49. Whether it&rsquo;s champagne
or beer or water, there&rsquo;s no difference when it
comes to quenching your thirst, and at my age
that&rsquo;s all you want to drink for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re a better philosopher than most of
the pioneers,&rdquo; said Gault, feeling the embar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>rassment
that the old man seemed so complacently
free from.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Philosopher!&rdquo; said the other, rising. &ldquo;Why,
my dear boy, I could found a school of philosophy&mdash;only
where would the pupils come from?
No, no; philosophy wouldn&rsquo;t pay in California;
too much blue sky and sunshine here.
Well, when are we going to see you again?
Soon&mdash;don&rsquo;t forget that. Viola and I haven&rsquo;t
many friends&mdash;just an odd one, like yourself,
here and there. Viola doesn&rsquo;t go much on society,
and so we let the old crowd drop; and
we&rsquo;re not sorry, not sorry&mdash;too many tares in
the wheat. What old Solomon said about a
dinner of herbs and good company being better
than a stalled ox in a wide house with a
brawling woman&mdash;wasn&rsquo;t that it?&mdash;was right.
He was a great old chap, Solomon! Brains
and experience&mdash;that&rsquo;s a combination that&rsquo;s
hard to beat.&rdquo;</p>

<p>They moved toward the door together, and
here the colonel turned on his friend for a last
good-by.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; he said, extending his hand
and smiling on the younger man with a bland
benignity of aspect that had in it something
paternally patronizing. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget that we
expect you soon. We&rsquo;re always at home in the
evenings, and always glad to see our friends&mdash;our
real friends.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span></p>

<p>When he had gone, Gault went to the window
of the outer office and stood there watching
him. The faded old hat, shadowing the
fringe of white hair, towered over the heads of
the hurrying men who passed in two streams
up and down the street.</p>

<p>Gault stood gazing till the tall figure passed
out of sight. When he turned back from the
window his clerks noticed that he looked
moodily preoccupied.</p>

<p>Five days after this the colonel appeared
again. He was urbane, affable, and easy as an
old shoe, and, with the air of a king honoring a
faithful servant, borrowed thirty dollars more.</p>

<p>This was on Saturday. On Sunday afternoon
Gault, who had passed a restless night,
resolved to escape from the irritation of his
own thoughts and seek amusement in the
society of Letitia. For this purpose he took
an early lunch at his club, and by two o&rsquo;clock
was wending his way up the sunlit streets that
run between large houses and blooming gardens
through what is known as the Western
Addition.</p>

<p>For the past six years it had been an open
secret in that small family circle that Mortimer
Gault and his wife wished to make a marriage
between John and Letitia. Certainly it was a
neat combination of the family relationships
and properties that might have suggested itself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>to any one. The ambition had originated with
Maud Gault, who, like most managing, clever
women, was a match-maker, and who, with her
social successes and pecuniary ambitions, would
naturally select as the husband of her only
sister this rich, agreeable, and presentable gentleman
who was so constantly in their society,
and who stood upon that footing of a semi-romantic
intimacy which distant relationship
gives. But it was difficult to force the two objects
of this matrimonial plot into sentimental
relations. Letitia was reserved upon the subject
of her own feelings. Mrs. Gault, who was not
reserved upon any subject except her age, could
get nothing out of the girl, either as to what she
herself felt for John or as to what she thought
he felt for her. Sometimes Letitia laughed a
little when the persistent questions of her sister
were hard to avoid; sometimes she blushed;
and once or twice she had grown angry and rebelled
against this intrusive catechizing. It
was difficult even for so keen a woman as Maud
Gault to read the girl&rsquo;s heart.</p>

<p>John Gault, who was sincerely fond of Letitia,
in a steady-going, brotherly way, watched
the man&oelig;uvers of his sister-in-law with a good
deal of inward amusement. He was confident
that Letitia entertained the same sort of regard
for him that he did for her, and he took an
honest and simple pleasure in the frank good-fel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>lowship
that existed between them. Now and
then, it is true, he had vaguely thought of the
young girl as his wife, and had wondered, in an
idle way, whether he could win her affection. He
thought that no man could ever find a better
wife than she would make. But these were
aimless speculations, and no one knew of them.
Even Maud Gault sometimes felt discouraged&mdash;he
was so exasperatingly pleased when she
told him of Letitia&rsquo;s admirers!</p>

<p>Though it was so early, Gault found one of
these rivals already before him. Tod McCormick,
the only son of Jerry McCormick, who
had been &ldquo;made&rdquo; by Colonel Reed, was sitting
with Letitia in the drawing-room, to which the
umbrella-plants and palms gave an overheated
and tropical appearance. The sunlight poured
into the room, and, shining through the green
of all this juicy and outspreading foliage over
the lustrous silks on piled-up cushions and upholstered
chairs, gave an impression of radiance
and color even more brilliant than that imparted
by the lamplight.</p>

<p>In the midst of the rainbow brightness Letitia
sat among the cushions. She was very upright,
for she was not of the long, lithe order of
women who lounge gracefully, but in her tight-drawn
silks and pendulating laces she found
her habitual attitude of square-shouldered
erectness more comfortable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span></p>

<p>Her guest, who rose to meet the newcomer,
looked as if he must be a changeling in the
blooming and lusty brood of Jerry McCormick.
While his sisters were women of that richness
of coloring and contour peculiar to California,
Tod was not five feet and a half high, and was
thin, meager, sallow-skinned, and weak-eyed.
A thatch of lifeless hair covered his narrow
head, and a small and sickly mustache had
been coaxed into existence on his upper lip.
He was in reality twenty-seven years old, but
he looked hardly twenty. Even his clothes, of
the most fashionable make and texture, could
not impart to him an air of elegance or style.
Their very splendor seemed to heighten his
insignificance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Howdy, Gault,&rdquo; he said, his small and weazened
countenance lightened by a fleeting and
evidently perfunctory smile. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re early,
but I&rsquo;m earlier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I came to see my brother,&rdquo; said the older
man, rather stiffly, for though he knew Tod to
be good-natured and harmless, he did not like
him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a pity!&rdquo; said Letitia. &ldquo;Maud and
Mortimer are both out. They&rsquo;re lunching at
the Murrays&rsquo;. But they&rsquo;ll be back soon now.
Won&rsquo;t you sit here with us?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though Tod&rsquo;s annoyance at this proposition
did not find vent in words, it was plain to be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>seen in the dejected and sullen expression that
settled on his face. With his hands in his
pockets, he stood looking down on his feet in
pointed patent-leather shoes, balancing absently
on his toes and heels.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, thanks,&rdquo; said Gault, whose dislike of
the young man did not go far enough to
blight his afternoon. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go into the library.
I&rsquo;ve got some letters to read over and answer,
and I&rsquo;ll do it now, while I am waiting.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned away and passed through the
wide hall-space to the library, a room at the
back of the house, where two large windows
commanded a view of the Golden Gate and the
bay. He had picked up a magazine from a
table in the hall, and now, seating himself, prepared
to look at it. But he presently threw it
aside, and abandoned himself to a dreamy survey
of the view.</p>

<p>The magnificent panorama of hills and water
lay still and enormous under the afternoon
sun. It was not late enough for the summer&rsquo;s
drought to have burned the hills, and the nearer
ones were a faint, mellow green. Their hollows
were filled with clear, amethyst shadows, and
the sea lay at their bases, motionless and level
like a blue floor. The extraordinary vividness
which marks the Californian landscape was
softened by the almost imperceptible haze
which overlay the scene. The watcher clasped
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>his hands behind his head, and looked with
troubled eyes at this splendid prospect. From
the room beyond came the murmur of conversation,
every now and then interrupted by the
high, cackling laugh of Tod McCormick. Presently
there was a break in the voices, they grew
louder and decreased, the hall door banged, and
Letitia came rustling into the room.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s too bad Maud and Mortimer are not
back yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ll have to talk to
me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault yawned, flung out his arms in a
stretch, and looked at her smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I told a little story in there. It was out of
consideration for the feelings of your young
man. I didn&rsquo;t come to see Mortimer. I came
to see you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no denying the fact that Letitia
looked pleased. She tried to hide her satisfaction
under an air of curiosity.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did you come to see me for?&rdquo; she
asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;To take a walk. It&rsquo;s too fine to stay indoors
talking to Tod McCormick. Go up-stairs
and put on your hat, and let&rsquo;s take a
<i>pasear</i>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia needed no urging. She rarely went
out alone with Gault, and the prospect of a
walk in his society was very attractive.</p>

<p>She was absent some time. When she re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>appeared
the cause of her delay was evident.
She had changed her dress, and now, in a
checked silk of black and white, and trimmed
with a wonderful arrangement of black gauze
and ribbon, she looked her best. A large black
hat with a brim shaded the upper part of her
face. In the back it was trimmed with some
green flowers which made a delightful harmony
with her copper-colored hair. Her cheeks were
slightly flushed, and as she entered the room,
conscious, perhaps, of her beauty and her vanity
in thus decking it, her eyes sought his, asking
for admiration.</p>

<p>Unfortunately he was not looking at her, but
was turning over the pages in the magazine he
had formerly discarded.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; he said, without looking
up, but hearing from the rustle of her dress
that she was beside him. &ldquo;I thought you were
never coming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Outside the house, they turned to the right
and walked slowly up the avenue, conversing
with the desultory indifference of old friends.
In the bright afternoon sunlight the broad
street stretched before them, almost deserted in
its Sunday calm. On either side the gardens
blazed with color, enameled with blooms of an
astonishing richness of tint. Over the tops
of fences nasturtiums poured blossoms that
danced in the air like tongues of fire. Scarlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>geraniums, topping long stalks, clothed with a
royal robe the summit of hedges. Against
sunny stretches of wall, heliotrope broke in a
purple foam. Climbing roses hung in heavy
clusters from vines that were drooping under
the weight of such a prodigal over-production.
The wide, sumptuous flowers of the purple
clematis clung round the balcony posts, completely
concealing the dry, thread-like vine that
gave them birth.</p>

<p>Between the houses, each one detached in
its own square of ground, with that suggestion
of space which is peculiar to San Francisco,
glimpses of the bay came and went&mdash;bits of the
gaunt hills, lengths of turquoise sea touched
here and there with a patch of white sail, and
sudden views of Alcatraz queening it alone on
its red-brown rock.</p>

<p>Letitia and Gault walked on, now and then
according the customary phrase to the beauty
of the landscape. Letitia, who was not an admirer
of nature, was much more interested in
the occasional couples they met, smart and
smiling in their Sunday attire; but, with the
complaisance of her amiable spirit, she was
always quick to echo her companion&rsquo;s enthusiasm.
Presently, after walking in silence for
a few minutes, he asked her:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How would you like to earn your own
living, Letitia?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span></p>

<p>This was rather an unexpected problem to
solve, but Letitia had no doubts on the subject,
and answered promptly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t like it at all.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But there are lots of women who have to&mdash;women
like you, who have had everything they
wanted, and been well taken care of, and then
their parents&mdash;relations&mdash;guardians lose their
money, and they have to work.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it would be better for them to
marry,&rdquo; said Letitia, sagely. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s much better
for a woman to marry, and have some one
to take care of her, than to have to take care
of herself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, suppose she doesn&rsquo;t want to marry,
or doesn&rsquo;t want to marry the kind of man that
asks her, isn&rsquo;t it better for her to work for her
living? Wouldn&rsquo;t a proud, self-respecting
woman rather work for her living than&mdash;than&mdash;than
not? You see, Letitia,&rdquo; he said, turning
to her with a smile, &ldquo;how much I think
of your opinion.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course, any woman would rather work
than go without things. She&rsquo;d have to. Why
do you want my opinion? Whom do you know
that has to work for her living?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no one in especial,&rdquo; he said, with a careless
shrug. &ldquo;It was just a supposititious case.
I was reading a novel about something like
that, and I thought I&rsquo;d get your opinion as an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[Pg 53]</a></span>intelligent, modern, up-to-date young person.&rdquo;
He looked at her again with his indulgent and
somewhat quizzical smile. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you all
that, Tishy?&rdquo; he asked, using the family
diminutive of her name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;whether I&rsquo;m
all that. I may be some of it. But it&rsquo;s so
awfully hard for a woman to support herself.
They have such a hard time, and get so badly
paid, and there are so few things that you
make money by soon, you know, without
studying for years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, it seems to me there are lots of things:
dressmaking, and type-writing, and&mdash;er&mdash;trimming
hats, and making jam, and reciting poems,
and teaching children.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, how could a girl type-write, or trim
hats, or even make jam, without knowing how?
You&rsquo;ve got to learn those things. I&rsquo;ve tried
to trim hats a dozen times, and always spoiled
them; and one summer Maud undertook to
make some jam, and it was perfectly awful&mdash;I
don&rsquo;t mean the jam: I mean the house while
the jam was getting made. Maud and the
Chinaman and Mortimer were all in such a
bad temper!&rdquo;</p>

<p>They walked on for a few moments in silence.
Then Letitia continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, even the girls who have fairly good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>positions in stores don&rsquo;t get enough to live on.
The girl who shampoos my hair has a sister in
Abram&rsquo;s, and she gets seven dollars a week,
and has to be nicely dressed. Just fancy that!&rdquo;
said Letitia; and then, in a burst of candor:
&ldquo;Why, I never in this world could dress on
that alone, even if I gave up silk stockings and
always wore alpaca petticoats like the woman
who teaches Maud German.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nevertheless,&rdquo; said Gault, &ldquo;it seems to me
that a woman who was high-minded and proud
and independent would be a shop-girl and live
on seven dollars a week rather than&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He stopped. Letitia looked at him interestedly,
struck by something in his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than what?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Rather than&mdash;well, in this story the people
who were so poor had friends that were
well off, and all that sort of thing, and they borrowed
from them, and&mdash;I think it&rsquo;s going to
turn out that they lived that way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did the girl borrow? Wouldn&rsquo;t work and
lived on the borrowed money? Oh, that&rsquo;s&mdash;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia raised both hands in the air and let
them drop with a gesture that expressed
complete finality of interest and approval.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean by &lsquo;oh,&rsquo; Letitia?&rdquo; he
said, rather sharply. &ldquo;I never said the girl
knew anything about it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she must have had some curiosity to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>know where the money came from. When her
father or mother came in and said, &lsquo;Here&rsquo;s
ten dollars to pay the butcher, and here&rsquo;s
twenty dollars to pay the grocer,&rsquo; don&rsquo;t you
suppose she wanted to know where it came
from? Really, John, considering you&rsquo;re supposed
to be so clever, you don&rsquo;t know much
about women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made no answer, and she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course she knew all about it. She
would have been an idiot if she hadn&rsquo;t. And
she doesn&rsquo;t sound at all like an idiot. It&rsquo;s just
the other way. She was clever&mdash;altogether too
clever. I don&rsquo;t like that kind of person at all.
I wouldn&rsquo;t trust her from here to the corner.
She must have been one of those soft, clinging,
gentle creatures who are always turning aside
to hide their tears. Was she?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say. You seem to know more about
her than I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But it sounds very interesting,&rdquo; said Letitia,
coming closer to him. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to read it.
What is the name of the book?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t remember. It&rsquo;s nonsense, anyway&mdash;some
stuff not worth talking about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia continued to look at him silently for
a moment; then she said slowly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not a book at all. It&rsquo;s a real person.
You&rsquo;ve been trying to make a fool of me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her quickly, his eyes, behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>shield of his glasses, narrowed to mere lines.
For a moment, as their cold gleam met hers,
she shrank, for she thought he was angry, and,
like other people, Letitia was afraid of John
Gault&rsquo;s anger. Then he smiled at her, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you ever have to earn <i>your</i> living, Tishy,
there&rsquo;ll be no trouble about your vocation.
You&rsquo;d make a fortune as a female detective. I
never saw such wonderful ability. Why, Sherlock
Holmes isn&rsquo;t in it with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can laugh as much as you like,&rdquo; said
Letitia, flushing under his sarcasms, &ldquo;but I
know I&rsquo;m right.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What!&rdquo; he said, coming to a standstill,
and staring into her face with a frown of
exaggerated intensity, &ldquo;you actually don&rsquo;t believe
me?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she retorted, doggedly combative.</p>

<p>&ldquo;After all these years, has my noble example
of truth and probity made no deeper impression
on you? Oh, Letitia, I couldn&rsquo;t have believed
it of you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care what you say,&rdquo; she repeated,
&ldquo;or how you try to turn it off. It&rsquo;s a real
person, and I&rsquo;m certain she&rsquo;s simply horrid.
And if you take <i>my</i> advice, the less you have
to do with her the better.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was apparently too much for the so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>briety
of John Gault. In the loneliness of the
street his laughter resounded deep and loud.
Letitia looked at him with moody disfavor as
he stood, his face flushed, his eyes suffused
with moisture, and fairly roared. Letitia&rsquo;s
eyes were threatened with a moisture of a different
kind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, dear Tishy,&rdquo; he said, when his paroxysm
was over, taking one of her hands and holding
it tightly, &ldquo;what a sage you are! How good
of you to warn me! With you to take care of
me, I ought never to come to any harm.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess you never would,&rdquo; said Letitia, with
a little sigh. &ldquo;Certainly I know enough to
know that that woman is not a good person to
trust&mdash;or even to know,&rdquo; added the mentor,
with an accent of warning, and staring at him
with large, cautioning eyes from under her
hat-brim.</p>

<p>Her companion was threatened with another
outburst.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Letitia, don&rsquo;t be so <i>funny</i>,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
haven&rsquo;t laughed as much as this for a month.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He took her hand and, drawing it inside his
arm, pressed it against his heart; then, looking
down at her with eyes still full of laughter, but
touched with tenderness, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;To think of Letitia Mason taking the trouble
to give me good advice!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia was mollified, less by his words than
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>by his manner, which had in it that kindly
camaraderie which made her feel happy and at
ease. She withdrew her hand, laughing, and
said, with a sort of shyness that was very
charming:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll always give you good advice, if you&rsquo;ll
promise not to laugh at me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then they walked on, talking of other things,
until the girl&rsquo;s spirits were restored to their
normal attitude of a sedate, candid cheeriness.
She grew quite talkative, discoursing to him of
various small happenings in the house, and not
noticing, in her recovered good humor, that
his answers were short and his manner grave
and distrait.</p>

<p>As they retraced their steps the broad, yellow
glow of the sunset deepened behind them, and
before them burned on the windows of houses
that climbed the hillsides still farther on. The
water and its low-lying shores&mdash;flat lands where
silver creeks lay embedded like the metal wires
in cloisonnÃ© ware&mdash;were already veiled in a
soft, purplish twilight which exhaled a creeping
chilliness. At a high point, unobstructed by
buildings, they turned to watch the sun drop
into the sea. For a moment it seemed to hesitate,
resting on the horizon like a spinning
copper disk; then it slipped out of sight, and
the darkness rushed up from unexpected places
and swept over the prospect, blotting out all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span>distinctions of color. Only in the west there
was a great gold radiance, against which little
red clouds floated like bits of raveled silk.</p>

<p>John Gault, as was his Sunday custom, dined
with his brother&rsquo;s family. After dinner he
left early, before the usual callers appeared&mdash;generally
young men come to bow the knee at
Letitia&rsquo;s shrine.</p>

<p>For a space he walked down the street with
a quick, decided step. Then, of a sudden, he
stopped, and stood looking at the pavement,
uncertain and irresolute. The car which had
borne him to the other side of town on the last
evening that he had dined with the Mortimer
Gaults glided across the avenue some blocks
farther down. He heard its bell and saw the
long funnel of light from its lantern pierce the
darkness before it.</p>

<p>He stood for a moment watching it, then
turned in the opposite direction and stopped.
As he hesitated, he heard in the distance the
bell of the next car. With a smothered ejaculation,
he wheeled about and ran for it. He
caught the car and swung himself to a front
seat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Kismet!&rdquo; he said to himself, as he sank
down panting.</p>

<hr class="chap" />

<div class="chapter">
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span></p>

<h2 id="III">III</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">A</span>T this period of his history the colonel&rsquo;s
exchequer must have been in a particularly
depleted condition, for it was not a week
after John Gault&rsquo;s visit that he again appeared
at the office, and this time requested a loan of
forty dollars.</p>

<p>Had the colonel, during this interview, exhibited
some of that shamefaced and conscious
embarrassment that the most hardened borrowers
will show, his benefactor would have
felt less miserably ill at ease. But the old man
was as suave and affably benignant as if he
were conferring a long-solicited favor. That
there was something of shame in his barefaced
assaults upon the purse of his daughter&rsquo;s friend
seemed an idea that had never entered his
mind. No disconcerting scruples marred his
appreciation of his sudden good fortune. Pride
was evidently a possession of which he was as
poorly supplied as he was with the tangible
goods of this world.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>He was in the best of spirits; indeed, to John
Gault&rsquo;s suspicious eye he had the triumphant air
of a man who had found a good thing. He came
into the office with a jaunty tread and an alert,
all-embracing glance, and left it showering
smiles and bows on its chief and his clerks. The
sun of his prosperity seemed to have warmed and
brightened him in every way. He told inimitable
stories of the early days, which&mdash;unhampered
by the presence of his daughter&mdash;were less
egotistical, and not always so conventional, as
those he regaled Gault with at home. He was
as pressing as ever in his invitations to call, and
into these introduced Viola&rsquo;s name as being a
participator with himself in the desire of seeing
their mutual friend as often as his time and
inclination would lead him to the house near
South Park.</p>

<p>After this visit the vague irritation and
moodiness that Gault had felt gave place to
a poignant sense of uncertainty and doubt.
Naturally of a suspicious nature, the life he had
led, the surroundings in which he had passed
from youth to maturity, the large experience
of evil gained in a twenty years&rsquo; residence in a
thoroughly loose and lawless city, had intensified
his original tendency till he was now prone
to suspect where suspicion was either a folly or
an insult. He had the vain man&rsquo;s dread of
being fooled, imposed upon, made ridiculous,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>and he was proud of his keenness in detecting
such intentions.</p>

<p>At twenty-two he had come from Harvard to
San Francisco, had plunged into the fashionable
life of the day, and being the son of wealthy
and well-known parents, had quickly learned
the bitter lessons which society teaches its followers.
People said John Gault had never
married because he believed in no woman.
This was an aspersion upon his sound, if narrow,
common sense. He was afraid of marriage,
of a terrible disillusionment, followed by a life-time
of conventionally correct misery. What
he feared in it was himself. He dreaded that
he might not make the woman he married
happy, and deep in his soul he cherished the
same dream as Balzac, who once wrote: &ldquo;To
devote myself to the happiness of a woman has
been my ceaseless dream, and I suffer because
I have not realized it.&rdquo; With the passage of
the years he had grown narrower and more
ambitionless. When he met Viola Reed he was
sinking into the dull apathy of a self-engrossed
and purposeless middle age.</p>

<p>Her attraction for him was sudden and compelling.
He often wondered why he liked her
so much. He had known hundreds of women
who were prettier and quite as clever. About
Viola there was a curious, distinguishing touch
of refinement that he did not find in many of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>the beauties and belles who were so ready to
smile on him at the fortnightly cotillions and
subscription germans. The delicate modesty
of her beauty satisfied his exacting eye.
There was something subtle and rare about her,
a suggestion of romance in her wide, pondering
eyes, a charm of mystery behind the face that
looked so youthful and yet was so femininely
secretive. She always seemed to say the right
thing, and that and the soft tones of her voice
were keenly pleasing to his fastidious taste.</p>

<p>At first he had merely sought her society for
the passing pleasure he had derived from it.
He was reaching that stage of life when he
found it difficult to be interested in new people,
and where the long tedium of a dinner next a
handsome and pretentious partner was beginning
to assume the aspect of a martyrdom.
There was nothing irksome or commonplace
or tedious in the evenings spent in the house
near South Park; even the colonel ceased to
be a bore when his daughter sat by listening.
Gault began to like going there better than
going anywhere else. On the days when he
decided that he would spend the evening at the
Reeds&rsquo;, he found himself looking forward to the
visit all the afternoon. The anticipation of it
lay like a glad thought at the bottom of his
heart. On the night that Letitia had asked
him about Colonel Reed&rsquo;s daughter, he had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>nearly arrived at a conclusion&mdash;that Viola
Reed was the one woman in the world for him.</p>

<p>Nearly, but not quite. The next day Colonel
Reed had come and borrowed the first fifty
dollars.</p>

<p>This simple action had disturbed John
Gault&rsquo;s serenity. The second and third visits
tore the fabric of his dream to pieces. If the
old man had only made his request once, he
would have thought no more of it than of the
numberless other loans which he had contributed
to the human wreckage left by the receding
tides of San Francisco&rsquo;s several booms. But the
colonel&rsquo;s subsequent appearances, so closely following
on Gault&rsquo;s visits, awoke a sudden swarm
of suspicions that began buzzing their importunate
warnings into his ears. Why had the
old man been so effusive in the beginning?
Why had he invited him, insisted even, upon
his calling? Was he so determinedly hospitable
merely to secure a listener to his reminiscences?
And if he had acted upon his own
impulses at first,&mdash;which certainly seemed the
case,&mdash;Viola could have stopped him later on.
Gault had noticed that her word seemed law to
her father.</p>

<p>In the pain of his doubts he surreptitiously
made inquiries, and discovered that Colonel
Reed&rsquo;s penury was of the past five years&rsquo; duration.
Up to that time he had still held small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>properties and realized on them at intervals.
People who knew said that since then his circumstances
had been desperate, and yet it was
known of all men that he was engaged in no
paid employment. It was the one point upon
which the pride of the erstwhile millionaire
was firm. Viola did no work, either. In the
West, the woman laboring to help sustain the
ruined fortunes of her family is so common a
spectacle that the strong man, secure in his
riches and his health, felt a species of fierce
indignation against the girl for her seeming
idleness.</p>

<p>Yet it must take so little to keep them.
They owned the house they lived in, and employed
no servant, Viola doing all the work of
the small menage. He had tried to persuade
himself that the colonel was using him for his
banker without the girl&rsquo;s knowledge, and then
Letitia, with her heavy feminine common sense,
had laid her finger on the weak spot in that
argument. How could a sudden influx of
money enter into so small a household without
the cognizance of the person who managed it
all? It was nonsensical to think of. She
knew&mdash;and if she knew, was she not party to
the whole sordid, ugly plot?</p>

<p>But here he always stopped. It was impossible.
It could not be. The image of her face
rose before him, as it often did now, making
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>him feel disgusted and ashamed that even in
thought he should have done her an injury.
There was a mistake somewhere. It would explain
itself. But he knew that until it did explain
itself he would know no peace; for he could
not live without seeing her, and at every visit
he felt her charm penetrate deeper into his
heart, despite his lurking doubts.</p>

<p>He spent hours in pondering as to the best
way to silence these doubts without letting her
suspect their existence. Even if she were cognizant
of it, he could hardly speak to her of
her father&rsquo;s borrowing. Yet in his thought
she always seemed so simple, so girlish, so
young, that he was sure if he could see her
alone, and perhaps turn the conversation upon
some analogous subject, her ignorance would
speak from every feature. He had grown to
know all the varying expressions of her face,
and he felt that he could detect the slightest
change of color or tremor of consciousness on
its pale innocence.</p>

<p>He did not, however, know at what hour he
was likely to find her by herself. He had always
gone in the evening, as it was the colonel
who asked him, and who invariably designated
that time. Gault fancied that his visits were
the old man&rsquo;s chief amusement and recreation,
and that he so particularly insisted upon the
evening in the desire not to miss them. Upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span>this hypothesis he concluded that he ran a better
chance of finding Viola alone in the second
half of the day, and on his first disengaged
afternoon he left his office early, with the
intention of walking across town to South
Park.</p>

<p>It was not late enough in the season for the
summer winds to have begun, and the straw,
dust, paper, and general refuse that they sweep
away with their steady, cold breath lay thick
on the pavements. In the hard light of afternoon
the dreary quarter looked even meaner
and more squalid than it did by night. The
wayfarer could see the dirt on the little shop-windows,
the dinginess of the wares displayed.
The small, open stands, where shell-fish and
oyster cocktails were sold, were thick with flies.
Behind the grimed glass of the pawnbroker&rsquo;s
windows lay the relics of vanished days of
splendor and extravagance. Old-fashioned
pieces of jewelry, broken ornaments, rusted
pistols, gold-mounted spectacles, mother-of-pearl
opera-glasses, were heaped together in
neglected disorder. Now and then the entrance
of a second-hand clothes store gave a
glimpse of a dark interior hung with clothes,
between which the sharp Jewish faces of the
patron and his wife peered out eagerly.</p>

<p>John Gault&rsquo;s eyes passed over this with slow
disgust. What might not the constant sight of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span>such naked poverty breed in the most sensitive
soul! Day after day Viola must have passed
this way, must have seen the human spiders
waiting in their dark web, perhaps might have
chaffered with them, or recognized her own
jewelry among the tarnished relics in the
pawnbroker&rsquo;s window.</p>

<p>He turned into the wider avenue, where gentility
had once dwelt in its bulky palaces.
They seemed to stare with wide, unshuttered
windows, drearily speculating on the desolation
of the street and their own decay. Around
them gardens stretched unkempt and parched,
here and there an aloe or some vigorously
growing shrub striking a note of color in the
uniform grayness. High iron gates, richly
wrought, but eaten into by rust, hung open
from broken hinges, or were tied together with
ravelings of rope. One of the most imposing,
still standing upright, was held ajar with a piece
of broken brick. It gave entrance to a circular
sweep of driveway and a large garden full of
rankly growing shrubs and vines and headless
statues, with a rusty fountain-basin in the center,
and urns still showing the corpses of geraniums.
Inside Gault saw some of the children of the
neighborhood playing games, and realized that
the broken brick was evidently of their introduction.
This was the house which had been
built by Jerry McCormick thirty-odd years be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>fore.
It had the appearance of having been
deserted for a century.</p>

<p>A few turns down narrower streets brought
the wayfarer to the Reeds&rsquo; home. He had
only seen it once before by daylight, and now
eyed it with curiosity. Though age and poverty
showed in its peeling stucco walls, in
the untended vines that hung about the bay-window,
in the rotting woodwork of the old
gate, it still had the air of a place that is lived
in and cared for. Inside the gate the pathway
of black-and-white marble was clean and bright.
Round the root of the dracÃ¦na there was a
flower-bed planted with mignonette. On the
other side of the flagged walk fuchsias and heliotrope
were trained against the high fence which
separated the house from its next-door neighbor.</p>

<p>In answer to his ring Viola opened the door.
She was dressed in a blue-and-white gingham
dress, the sleeves of which were rolled up to
the elbows, and showed arms slightly rounded
and white as milk. She wore an apron and
had a pair of scissors in her hand. When she
saw who it was the color of joy ran in a beautiful
flush over her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You never came at this time before,&rdquo; she
said in the hall, hastily pulling down her sleeves.
&ldquo;I never thought for a moment it was you, or
I shouldn&rsquo;t have come to the door with my
sleeves this way.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span></p>

<p>Then they passed into the drawing-room.
The afternoon light streamed through the bare
emptiness of this once stately apartment, revealing
the long crack that zigzagged across the
mirror, and the rents in the colonel&rsquo;s arm-chair.
In the rear half of the room there were only
one or two pieces of furniture, evidently seldom
used, and pushed back into the corners. The
double doors leading from here were open, and
vouchsafed the visitor a view of one of those long
and spacious dining-rooms, with an outer wall
of glass, often seen in old San Francisco houses.
Fronting this glass wall were tiers of plants,
some mounted on rough boxes, some on tables.
They were of many sizes and sorts, but the
feathery foliage of the maidenhair was most
in evidence. It seemed to be growing in every
kind of receptacle, from the ordinary flower-pot
to a tomato-can on one side and a huge
kerosene-oil tin on the other. Near the dining-table
was a chair, and the table itself was littered
with brown paper, cut neatly into circular
pieces about three inches in diameter.</p>

<p>Viola moved forward to close the doors, but
was arrested by her visitor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, you&rsquo;ve a regular conservatory in
there. What beautiful plants!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She held the door open and let him look in,
though apparently not quite at her ease.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I have great luck with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span>ferns. Some people have, you know. It&rsquo;s just
because we take more care of them than others.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister-in-law would die of envy if she
could see those,&rdquo; said Gault, indicating the
maidenhairs; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s always buying that sort
of thing, and they&rsquo;re always dying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola looked at him thoughtfully for a moment.
The color deepened in her cheeks, and
then she looked away and began to play with
the lock of the door.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must buy a great many,&rdquo; she said, with
a questioning inflection.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Cart-loads,&rdquo; said he, absently, wondering
what had caused her augmented color, and
watching her as he would always now watch
her whenever there was the slightest deviation
from her normal manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And I suppose,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;she spends a
great deal on them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;judging by
the number that I&rsquo;ve seen wither in their
prime and disappear, and new ones take their
places the next day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola pressed the lock in and shot it out.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are any of them dead just now?&rdquo; she
asked, in rather a small voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dozens, probably. It seems to me some of
them are always dead, only they&rsquo;re considerate
enough not to all die at the same time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Gault&rsquo;s gaze
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span>was diverted from her face to the high, old-fashioned
room, with its marble mantel carved
in fruits and flowers and its bare sideboard.
Then Viola said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Your sister-in-law always gets her plants
from the large florists, doesn&rsquo;t she? Some one
on Kearney or Sutter Street?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say she does; but I&rsquo;m sure I don&rsquo;t
know. I can&rsquo;t control my curiosity any further&mdash;what
were you going to do with those round
bits of paper you were cutting when I came in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him quickly, a look of sharp,
dubious inquiry; then, as she met the amused
curiosity of his glance, she gave a little laugh
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was going to make jam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t make jam out of paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; those are for the tops of the glasses.
I soak them in brandy and put them on, and
they preserve it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at the papers, then back at her.
As their eyes met the delight each felt in the
other&rsquo;s presence found expression in a simultaneous
burst of laughter. For a moment they
stood facing each other, laughing in foolish but
happy lightness of heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, you know,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m a credulous
person, but isn&rsquo;t that going too far? Why, if
you used all those things you&rsquo;d have jam
enough to feed the American army.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>Her laughter died, and looking slightly confused,
she put out her hand, seized the other
door, and drew them together with a bang.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There!&rdquo; she said, dropping the catch; &ldquo;you
can&rsquo;t see any more. You&rsquo;re too curious, in the
first place, and you don&rsquo;t believe me, which is
worse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve found out the skeleton in the closet,&rdquo;
he said, as they walked back into the front
room. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the colonel&rsquo;s passion for jam.
I&rsquo;ve heard of a passion for pie running in
families, but jam&rsquo;s something new.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The bare austerity of this bleak apartment
seemed to cast a sudden chill over their high
spirits. Gault, sitting in the colonel&rsquo;s chair, reverted
in thought to the object of his visit, and
wondered how he could turn the conversation
in the direction he had intended. His preoccupation,
and the sense of shame he felt at the
mean part he contemplated playing, made him
respond to her conversational attempts with
dry shortness. She grew constrained and embarrassed,
and finally, in a desperate attempt
to arrest a total silence, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like my new cushion? You&rsquo;ve
never noticed it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The visitor&rsquo;s slow glance moved in the direction
indicated, and rested on a cretonne cushion
in one of the wicker chairs.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a perfect beauty,&rdquo; he said, with as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>much enthusiasm as he thought the occasion
required.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad you think it&rsquo;s pretty,&rdquo; she answered,
evidently much pleased. &ldquo;I ought not
to have bought it, I suppose, but I do love
pretty things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why oughtn&rsquo;t you to have bought it?
What is the matter with it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing; I mean it was an extravagance.
I sometimes think how perfectly delightful it
would be to be able to go into stores and buy
furniture and ornaments and curtains just
whenever you wanted.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This remark dispelled Gault&rsquo;s preoccupation.
He remained in the same position and continued
staring at the cushion, but his glance had
changed from its absent absorption to a fixed
and listening intentness.</p>

<p>Viola saw that she had interested him, and
continued with happy volubility:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sometimes, when I have nothing to do and
am here alone, I think how I would furnish
this room if I could buy anything I saw, and
could just say to some outside person, the way
princesses do, &lsquo;I have bought so much; please
pay the bill.&rsquo; I&rsquo;ve done it in white and gold,
and in crimson with black wood, teak or ebony,
very plain and heavy; and also in striped
cretonnes with bunches of flowers, and little
chairs and sofas with spindle legs. There&rsquo;s a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>great deal of satisfaction in it. It&rsquo;s almost as
good as having it really happen.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It sounds very amusing,&rdquo; said Gault, as she
paused; &ldquo;but then, castles in the air,&rdquo; he added,
turning to look at her, &ldquo;are never quite the
same as the real thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you can&rsquo;t get the real thing, you take the
castles in the air,&rdquo; she answered, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tell me some more of yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, they&rsquo;re just silly dreams, and mercenary
ones, too. My castles are all built on a
foundation of money. It&rsquo;s a dreadful thing to
have to acknowledge, but I&rsquo;m afraid I am
mercenary. And it&rsquo;s such a horrid fault to
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it rather a useful one?&rdquo; he could
not forbear asking.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not so far. Once I had my palm read by
a palmist, and he told me I was going to be
very prosperous&mdash;to have great riches. That&rsquo;s
one of my best castles in the air. I&rsquo;m all the
time wondering about it, and where my great
riches are coming from.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spread both hands, palms up, on the
table, and studied them as if trying to elicit
further secrets from their delicately lined surfaces.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great riches!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Where
could a person suddenly find great riches?
The mining booms are over, and in California
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span>people don&rsquo;t strike oil-wells in their gardens.
I&rsquo;m afraid it will have to be either begging,
borrowing, or stealing. I wonder which I
would succeed best in.&rdquo;</p>

<p>With the last words she raised her bent head,
and her eyes, diminished in size by her laughter,
rested full on his. Their glance was clear, candid,
and innocently mirthful as that of a merry
child.</p>

<p>As he stared at her, almost vacantly, the
notes of a clock, striking somewhere in the
back of the house, fell with crystalline distinctness
upon the silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four&mdash;five,&rdquo; she counted
absently, with each number touching the table
with a finger-tip.</p>

<p>Gault rose to his feet, remarking with unfeigned
surprise on the lateness of the hour.
She looked suddenly confused and annoyed at
the realization of her unintentional rudeness,
and asked him if he would not remain till her
father&rsquo;s return. But he pleaded an engagement
he had made to attend the tea given that afternoon
by Mrs. Jerry McCormick, and, with a
hand pressure and the conventional words of
farewell, brought his visit to a close.</p>

<p>Outside, he turned to the right and walked
slowly forward toward where the rumble of
traffic indicated one of the large and populous
thoroughfares of the district. Before him, at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>the end of the street&rsquo;s long vista, the sunset
glowed pink, barred by a delicate scoring of
telegraph-wires. Even as he looked it deepened
and burned higher and higher up the sky,
while at the far end of the vista it concentrated
into a core of brightness, as though a conflagration
were in progress there.</p>

<p>What was he to think? He felt his mind confused
and full of warring images. He had been
almost afraid of what she might say&mdash;she who
was to him the ideal of all that was gentlest
and truest and most maidenly. And yet what
had she said to disturb or annoy him? It was
only the foolish prattle of a girl who is happy
and in high spirits. And even as he made
these assurances to himself, sentences from the
past interview surged up to the surface of his
mind: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m mercenary, and it&rsquo;s
such a horrid fault to have.&rdquo; &ldquo;Where are my
riches coming from? It will have to be either
begging, borrowing, or stealing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her mother had been an actress&mdash;one of the
stars of San Francisco&rsquo;s hectic youth. Dissimulation
might be instinctive with a woman
of Viola Reed&rsquo;s heredity. It was the whole art
of acting; it was in her blood. He thought of
all he had ever heard of her mother, of her few
years of fame and glory, so splendidly ended
by her marriage to the bonanza millionaire. It
had been a wonderful, glittering life, quenched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>in an early death. He had never heard anything
against her character, but she had been
an actress, the essence of whose art is the capacity
to both conceal and assume emotion.
And her daughter, in personal appearance at
least, resembled her. He had heard that from
the colonel himself.</p>

<p>A feeling of weariness and disillusion took
possession of him, and in the sickness of heart
that it brought he thought suddenly of Letitia.
She was the one woman he knew that he could
always rely on to be true and steadfast and
genuine. Why had he not loved her&mdash;a woman
a man could trust forever, and handsome
enough to be the wife of a king? There would
be no doubts nor difficulties in a life with her;
it would be all kindness and cheer and sympathy.
And even as he thus reflected, he knew
that love for Letitia was as far from him as
was indifference to the woman whom he mistrusted.</p>

<p>At the very hour that Gault was walking
moodily across town from South Park, Letitia,
the object of his thoughts, was rolling along
the asphalted streets of the Western Addition
in Mrs. Mortimer Gault&rsquo;s coupÃ©. Her sister
was with her, and both ladies were dressed
with a rustling splendor which betokened festal
doings. For they, too, were en route to the
McCormick tea. This was, in fact, a large
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span>reception given by Mrs. McCormick to little
Prince Dombroski, a gentleman who had come
from Russia to wed a Californian heiress, and
was receiving a helping hand from the McCormicks,
who on this particular afternoon had
gathered together all maiden and widowed San
Franciscan wealth for his inspection.</p>

<p>Letitia had dressed herself for the occasion
with great care. When she had appeared at the
front door and descended the stairs to the carriage,
she had presented so dazzling a picture
that even the coachman, a well-trained functionary
imported from the East, could hardly
forbear staring at her. She was regally clothed
in a costume of bluish purple, with much yellow
lace, fur, cream-colored satin, and glints of gold
braiding about the front. There was a purple
jewel at her throat, and a bunch of pale, crape-like
orchids, that toned with the hue of her
dress, was fastened on her breast. Clad thus
in the proudest production of a great French
modiste, Letitia was really too handsome to be
quite in good taste. But she was used to
sumptuous apparel, and carried it with the air
of an actress who knows how to take the stage.</p>

<p>Maud Gault was somewhat less punctual to-day
than her sister. Letitia sat in the carriage
waiting for her, and finally, by the brushing of
silken skirts and an advancing perfume of
wood-violet, was apprised of her sister&rsquo;s ap<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span>proach.
The elder woman gave the address to
the coachman and then sprang in.</p>

<p>Hardly had the door closed when she looked
at Letitia with a kindling eye, and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tishy, I know the funniest thing!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia knew that her sister had something
of note to impart. Mrs. Gault&rsquo;s dark cheek
was flushed a fine brick-red, her eye was alight.
She was pulling on her gloves as she spoke.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember that night, only a few
weeks ago, when you asked John about Colonel
Reed&rsquo;s daughter?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And do you remember that he said he&rsquo;d
never seen her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, he didn&rsquo;t say that,&rdquo; corrected Letitia;
&ldquo;he said he&rsquo;d heard of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what else?&rdquo; asked the other, stopping
in her glove-pulling to fix Letitia with a keen
eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think he said anything else. I don&rsquo;t
remember anything.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But he certainly led us to believe that he
didn&rsquo;t know her. Didn&rsquo;t he, now?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia paled slightly. Her eyes, looking
frankly troubled, were fastened on her sister.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I think so. Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, my dear,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gault, bridling
with the consciousness of her important announcement,
&ldquo;he knows her well. He goes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span>there all the time. He&rsquo;s having a regular
affair with her. Did you ever know anything
to beat men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you know?&rdquo; said Letitia, looking
down and picking at the gold arabesques on
her dress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortimer told me last night. He made me
swear I wouldn&rsquo;t tell a living soul. You must
remember that, by the way, or I&rsquo;ll get into
trouble. Mortimer saw Colonel Reed in the
office the other day, and that red-haired clerk,
the one John took in because his mother was
crazy or consumptive or something, told Mortimer
Colonel Reed came there often, and that
John went out to see him at his home somewhere
near South Park. Doesn&rsquo;t that beat
the band? John going calling in South Park
on Colonel Reed&rsquo;s daughter, and then pretending
to us that he doesn&rsquo;t know her! If John
knew the man had said anything about it, he&rsquo;d
kick him down all the stairs in the building, if
they reached from here to the ferry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia was silent. She thought of the conversation
on Sunday, and the woman who had
been the heroine of the novel. All the sunshine
seemed to go out of the afternoon, and
the innocent joy she had taken in putting on
her beautiful clothes suddenly shriveled up
and vanished.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He might go out there and see Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>Reed&rsquo;s daughter and not tell us about it,&rdquo; she
said, &ldquo;and yet not&mdash;not be exactly in love with
her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Letitia,&rdquo; said her sister, pettishly,
&ldquo;what a dunce you are! Do you suppose
John&rsquo;s going to drag himself over to South
Park to see Colonel Reed&rsquo;s daughter because
he&rsquo;s taken a philanthropic interest in her father?
One would think you&rsquo;d been raised in
Oshkosh or Milpitas, to hear the things you
sometimes say. But that&rsquo;s not all. This
morning I was in the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange, and
who should be there but old Biddy McCormick
herself. I can&rsquo;t endure her, you know, especially
since she&rsquo;s got this little prince-creature
up her sleeve; but I&rsquo;m always polite to her because
of Tod and you&mdash;and things generally.
You never can tell what may happen. And I
heard her say, &lsquo;Not that jam; I always buy
the same kind&mdash;Miss Viola Reed&rsquo;s.&rsquo; So I up
and said, as innocent as Mary&rsquo;s little lamb, &lsquo;Do
tell me, Mrs. McCormick, what jam that is
you&rsquo;re buying. Everything you have is always
so delicious.&rsquo; And she said, &lsquo;It&rsquo;s some that&rsquo;s
made by a woman named Reed, who lives
across town somewhere.&rsquo; Then, when she&rsquo;d
gone, I corralled the girl, and she told me it was
made by a Miss Viola Reed, who lives&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gault opened her jeweled card-case and
produced a slip of paper with an address
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>written on it. She handed this to Letitia, and
said with an air of triumph:</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s where she lives. Now you&rsquo;ll have
to admit, Miss Letitia Mason, that there are no
flies on your little sister!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked at the address and gave it back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said her sister; &ldquo;you keep it. That&rsquo;s
my little scheme. You&rsquo;re to go there now&mdash;this
afternoon&mdash;and order jam. Do you see?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want any jam, and you never
eat it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious, Tishy, how awfully stupid
you are to-day! What a fortunate thing it is
that you and Mortimer have got me to take
care of you! Of course you don&rsquo;t want jam.
I never heard of any civilized being who did.
But I suppose you&rsquo;ll admit that you want to
see this girl?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I do,&rdquo; said Letitia. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
see why I should.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I do,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gault, with asperity.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you take an interest in John? Don&rsquo;t
you want to see if he&rsquo;s fallen into the clutches
of an adventuress?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t sound at all like an adventuress,
Maud. I never heard of an adventuress
making jam for her living.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Jam for her living! Bosh! Can&rsquo;t you
imagine how she tells that to John, and shows
him the glasses in the corner cupboard, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span>lets him find her stirring things in a big pot on
the kitchen stove? Oh, she&rsquo;s no fool, my dear!
Will you go and see her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very well, then; if you care so little for
John, you needn&rsquo;t go. I&rsquo;ll do it myself, and
I can tell you, I&rsquo;ll size her up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked uneasy. She knew nothing
of Miss Reed except that she was poor and
pretty. But she did not like the thought of
subjecting even an unknown female to Mrs.
Gault&rsquo;s mercies, when her interest was so evidently
hostile and her curiosity so poignant.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you think somebody must go, then I
will,&rdquo; she said pacifically. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see the use
of it, but I can go better than you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gault, immediately
placated. &ldquo;You&rsquo;d better go now. It&rsquo;s always
best to do a thing when you have the opportunity.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Letitia; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;ll do
that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why not? Is it possible you&rsquo;re so crazy
to see that miserable little prince that I could
put in my hat-box?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care about him,&rdquo; answered the girl,
with unmoved placidity. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to go&mdash;to
go this way.&rdquo; She made an explanatory gesture
toward her dress.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gault looked at her uncomprehendingly.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? What&rsquo;s wrong about your clothes?&rdquo;</p>

<p>It was painful, but Letitia had to explain:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If she&rsquo;s so poor as all that&mdash;and everybody
says so&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s&mdash;it&rsquo;s&mdash;quite nice,
some way or other, for me to go in this dress.&rdquo;
Her voice took on a sudden tone of decision.
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t do it, anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her sister knew the tone, and knew that
there was no use in combating the mood it
indicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You have the queerest notions,&rdquo; she said,
with a resigned sigh; &ldquo;but do as you like.
It&rsquo;s all the same, if you do go to-morrow.
Only you must promise that you won&rsquo;t back
out.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia promised.</p>

<p>On the afternoon of the next day she stood
before her glass and critically eyed her reflection.
She had put on a plain tailor-made suit,
which fitted her heavily molded figure with
unwrinkled smoothness. A brown turban
crowned her reddish hair, and the exquisite
pallor of her skin was obscured by a thin
veil. Letitia did not approve of herself in this
modest garb. She accepted the dictum that
&ldquo;beauty should go beautifully.&rdquo; But for the
mission upon which she was bound she had
selected her attire with an eye to its fitness and
propriety.</p>

<p>It was a gray afternoon, with a breath of fog
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>in the air. Already the city was beginning to
show signs of the summer exodus, and Letitia
was glad that in her journey across town she
met no acquaintances and attracted no more
attention than that frankly candid stare which
is male California&rsquo;s passing tribute to beauty.</p>

<p>Though she had been born in South Park, she
knew nothing of this side of the city, and found
herself as much a stranger as its inhabitants
would have been had they been transported to
the aristocratic heart of the Western Addition.
Finally, however, after some questioning of
small boys and much retracing of steps, she
found the house, and walked up the path with
the black-and-white flagging.</p>

<p>Letitia was one to whom the word &ldquo;shyness&rdquo;
has no meaning. She possessed her full share
of the Westerner&rsquo;s placid self-approval, and
with it that careless curiosity which makes an
incursion into new surroundings interesting.
Yet, as she stood waiting for the door to open,
she experienced a sensation of nervousness quite
new to her. Her heart had ached more in the
last twenty-four hours than it had since her
mother&rsquo;s death, years before. If Viola Reed
was an adventuress or if she was a saint, the
situation was equally painful to this splendid-looking
creature, who, for all her regal air and
stately immobility of demeanor, was only a
woman of a simple, almost primitive type.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>
<p>The door was opened by Viola, in her blue
gingham dress and her apron. At the sight
of her visitor she looked startled almost into
speechlessness. Letitia announced the fact
that she had come on business, and an invitation
to enter brought her sweeping into the
little hall and the drawing-room beyond.</p>

<p>Here the two girls looked at each other for
one of those swift exploring moments in which
women seem to take in every detail of dress,
every peculiarity of feature and revealing
change of expression, that a rival has to show.
Letitia, with all her apparent heaviness, had
keen perceptions. With a sinking at her heart
she saw the beauty of the gray eyes fastened
shyly upon her, and realized what must be the
power of the delicate charm, so far removed in
its soft, dependent femininity from her own.
She saw that this girl had a distinguishing refinement
she could never boast, and that it was
strong enough to triumph over such poverty-stricken
surroundings as, in all her experience,
she had never before encountered. Her quick
eye took in the gaunt emptiness of the room
as John Gault&rsquo;s could not have done in a week&rsquo;s
arduous examination. She saw the split and
ragged shades in the windows, the ribs of twine
in the old carpet, the rents in the colonel&rsquo;s
chair.</p>

<p>Viola, for her part, saw one of the handsomest
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span>and most imposing young women she had ever
gazed upon. The very way Letitia rustled
when she moved, and exhaled a faint perfume
with every movement, seemed to breathe an
atmosphere of fashion and elegance. She had
never seen her before, and had no idea who she
was. Letitia soon put an end to this condition
of ignorance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My name is Mason,&rdquo; she said judicially&mdash;&ldquo;Letitia
Mason. I am the sister of Mrs. Mortimer
Gault.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At this announcement an instantaneous
change took place in Viola. For a second she
looked alarmed, then her face stiffened into
lines of pride and anger. The eyes that had
been so full of a naÃ¯ve admiration were
charged, as by magic, with a look of cold antagonism.
Letitia felt her own breath quicken
as she realized how much the name of Gault
must mean to this girl.</p>

<p>Viola attempted no answer to the introduction,
and Miss Mason hastily went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;My sister heard that you made jam&mdash;very
good jam. We don&rsquo;t like what we get in the
stores, so we thought we would try yours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola had now found her voice,&mdash;a very low
and cold one,&mdash;and answered:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You can get it at the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange.
I sell it there all the time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I know that,&rdquo; said Letitia; &ldquo;but we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span>thought it would be better to buy it straight
from you; that&mdash;perhaps&mdash;it&mdash;perhaps it would
save time and trouble.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see how it could do that. This part
of town is a long distance out of everybody&rsquo;s
way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course it is,&rdquo; the other agreed
eagerly; then, with a sudden happy inspiration,
&ldquo;but I thought you might have a larger variety
here&mdash;that you might have a good many
different kinds on hand. I don&rsquo;t want all the
same sort.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola rose and went to the door that led to
the dining-room. Her resentment was not more
obvious than her embarrassment. There was
something tremulous in the expression of her
face that gave Letitia a wretched feeling that
only pride enabled her to keep back her tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have just the same here that I have at the
Exchange,&rdquo; she said, opening the doors.</p>

<p>The visitor followed her. In the gray of the
afternoon the long room, with its tiers of plants
and its bare sideboard and mantelpiece, looked
even colder and drearier than the drawing-room.
Viola opened a cupboard and indicated
the lines of glass jars standing on the shelves.
She tried to be businesslike, and told their
contents and prices, but her voice betrayed her.
Letitia, listening to her and staring at the Chinese
cracker-jar that was the sole adornment
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>of the sideboard, suddenly felt sick with disgust
at herself for intruding, at her sister, at
John Gault.</p>

<p>As Viola&rsquo;s voice went on,&mdash;&ldquo;These are apricots;
they&rsquo;re fifty cents. Those on that shelf
are strawberry and raspberry; they are only
thirty,&rdquo;&mdash;Letitia&rsquo;s shame and indignation
worked up to a climax and a resultant
resolution.</p>

<p>She took up one of the glasses and, looking
at the legend written in neat script on the
paper top, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think I ought to tell you how I happened
to come here. It&rsquo;s really a secret and you
mustn&rsquo;t tell. What I said at first was not
quite the case. No one at our house knows
anything about this but me. I&rsquo;m going to buy
these preserves for my brother-in-law and tell
him I made them. I&rsquo;m going to fool him. Do
you understand? It&rsquo;s just a little joke.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia delivered herself of this amazing
effort at invention with admirable composure,
for it was the first elaborate and important
falsehood she had ever told in her life. Viola,
turning from her contemplation of the shelves,
looked at her, relieved but not quite comprehending.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So I hunted you up myself at the Exchange,&rdquo;
continued Letitia, plunging deeper
into the slough of deception, but knowing now
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span>that she had gone too far to compromise with
truth, &ldquo;and came here myself this way so as to
keep it all dark.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola&rsquo;s face had cleared with each word. As
the other ended, her lips parted in the smile
that John Gault found at once so irresistible
and so enigmatic. Letitia found nothing enigmatic
in it. She only thought, with a piercing
dart of pain, &ldquo;She is still prettier when she
smiles.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very amusing,&rdquo; said Viola; &ldquo;but why
do you want to fool him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia was even ready for this, so expert
does the first lie make us in perpetrating the
second.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He says I am useless and can&rsquo;t do anything.
I am going to show him that I can make jam.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola was rather shocked, but relief and
amusement combined to make her light-hearted,
and this time she laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the writing,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Won&rsquo;t he see
by that that it&rsquo;s not yours? There&rsquo;s writing
on every glass.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, that will be all right. I&rsquo;ll have the
Chinaman put it out in a dish. But you&rsquo;ll
promise not to give me away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I never will,&rdquo; said Viola. &ldquo;In fact,&rdquo; she
continued naÃ¯vely, &ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather have it that
way myself. You see, many people&mdash;all people,
that is&mdash;don&rsquo;t know that I do this.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span></p>

<p>She stopped and looked tentatively at Letitia,
as if curious to see how she was taking these
revelations.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do what?&rdquo; asked Letitia, not understanding.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make the jam. Not that I mind much.
But it&rsquo;s a little sort of fancy of my father&rsquo;s.
Sometimes older people have those ideas, and
it&rsquo;s best to humor them, I think; don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, much the best,&rdquo; assented the other,
turning aside and looking at the plants. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s
best to humor everybody; it&rsquo;s so much easier
to get on. What beautiful ferns!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; I am quite proud of them. But this
is a splendid window for ferns.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did you raise these yourself? I never saw
such plants out of a greenhouse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola was now eagerly interested.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I grew them all&mdash;some of them from
a few roots like black threads. I sell these,
too. There is a man at one of the Kearney
Street florists&rsquo; who used to live near here and
knew us, and he buys them from me. At
Christmas I do quite well.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia examined the ferns.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wonder if you would let me buy one or
two of them,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We can&rsquo;t get such
plants at our florist&rsquo;s, and I am fonder of them
than of any other kind of fern.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola agreed with a blush of pleasure, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span>after some consultation four ferns were selected.
The visitor was amazed at their cheapness, but
concealed her astonishment. Then she bought
three dozen jars of the jam. She did not pay
for them, but said that on the following day
she would send the money by a messenger, who
would also bring away the purchases.</p>

<p>Standing in the doorway, about to leave, she
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad to have seen you. It&rsquo;s so interesting
for a person like me, who can&rsquo;t do anything,
to meet some one who is clever and of use
in the world. Good-by!&rdquo; She held out her
hand, and Viola, surprised, put hers into it.
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t forget to keep our secret. It makes a
person feel like a conspirator, doesn&rsquo;t it? I
think, too, Colonel Reed&rsquo;s quite right to want
to be reticent about business matters. So you
and I&rsquo;ll keep dark about this little transaction
of ours.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This was the most diplomatic sentence Letitia
had ever given vent to in her life.</p>

<p>She walked slowly away from the house, her
eyes downcast in thought. The superb health
she had inherited from an untainted peasant
ancestry made her imagination dull, and lightened
such sufferings as she had encountered in
her easy, care-free life. Even now she experienced
none of those fierce pangs that jealousy
and disappointed love provoke in the women
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>of a more sophisticated stock. She was made
on that large, calm plan on which an all-wise
nature creates the maternal woman&mdash;she whose
destiny it is to bear strong children to a stalwart
sire. But this afternoon, for the first
time in her life, she knew what it was to feel
her heart lying heavy in her breast like a thing
of stone.</p>

<p>It was late when she reached home. Mrs.
Gault was to give a dinner that evening, and as
Letitia passed through the hall she caught a
glimpse of her sister, in a loose creation of pink
silk and lace, which swelled out behind her like
a sail, hurrying round the bedecked dining-table,
followed by two meek and attentive Chinamen.
Knowing the indignation of Maud
should she be late, she ran to her room and
made her toilet with the utmost speed.</p>

<p>She was just completing this important rite,
and, seated at her dressing-table under a blaze of
electric light, was selecting an aigret for her hair,
when the door opened and Mrs. Gault entered.</p>

<p>She had discarded her ebullient draperies of
pink silk, and was sheathed tightly in her favorite
yellow, from which the olive skin of her
bared neck emerged in polished smoothness.
As she came forward she had one hand full of
diamond brooches, which she pinned with apparent
carelessness round the edge of the low
bodice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tishy,&rdquo; she said, sitting down by the
dressing-table, &ldquo;what happened?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked at the array of silver that covered
the table. Some jewels lay scattered
among it, and the aigrets from which she had
been about to choose the one she should wear.
She selected a black one, and turned it round,
looking at it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing happened,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I saw
her, and bought the jam and some plants. She
raises plants, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is she really so pretty?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, very&mdash;I think some people might say
beautiful.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Gault&rsquo;s face fell.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She didn&rsquo;t say anything about John, I
suppose?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course not.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did it seem to you that there was anything
adventuressy or bad about her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked at her sister&mdash;a sidelong look,
which made Mrs. Gault feel rather uncomfortable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I never saw any one in my life that looked
to me less so,&rdquo; she answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; ejaculated Mrs. Gault, in a dismayed
tone. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t say so! Tishy, for
goodness&rsquo; sake, look where you&rsquo;re putting that
aigret! You look like Pocahontas, and Tod
McCormick&rsquo;s coming to dinner.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span></p>

<p>Letitia arranged the aigret at a more satisfactory
angle, her large white arms, shining
like marble through the transparent tissue of
her sleeves, shielding her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; said Mrs. Gault, returning to the
more important subject, &ldquo;there really may be
a chance of his marrying her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I should think a very good one,&rdquo; answered
Letitia, in a low voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; breathed her sister, in the
undertone of utter horror, &ldquo;how awful men
are! What makes you think he may intend
marrying her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because,&rdquo; said Letitia, dropping her arms
and turning on her sister with her mouth
trembling and her breast agitated with sudden
emotion, &ldquo;no man who was any sort of a man
could mean anything else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Maud Gault was amazed by the girl&rsquo;s unexpected
emotion. She pushed back her chair,
and staring at Letitia, said vaguely:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why? I don&rsquo;t understand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Even if he didn&rsquo;t care, even if he didn&rsquo;t
love her, he&rsquo;d marry her. Oh, Maud, she&rsquo;s
so helpless and so poor!&rdquo;</p>

<p>And Letitia burst into a sudden storm of tears.</p>

<p>For a moment her sister sat still, looking at
her in blank amazement. Then she felt a pang
of feminine sympathy. So Letitia did care for
him. Poor Tishy!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;There, don&rsquo;t cry!&rdquo; she said, patting her
shoulder. &ldquo;You never can tell about these
things. John may not care a button for this
girl, or have the least intention of marrying
her. You&rsquo;re always seeing the dark side of
things.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But her form of consolation was not well
chosen. Letitia threw off the hand and raised
her disfigured face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;John may be selfish and mean and all that,
and I&rsquo;ve no doubt he is; but he&rsquo;s not mean
enough, he&rsquo;s not contemptible enough, to do
what you think he&rsquo;s doing. I&rsquo;ll not believe
that of him. I&rsquo;d despise him if I thought so;
I&rsquo;d hate him!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tears burst forth afresh, and she hid her
face in her hands.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gault was nonplussed. She looked at
her sister&rsquo;s shaken shoulders and bowed head
with an uncomprehending but pitying eye.
Then, as Letitia&rsquo;s sobs diminished, she said
gloomily:</p>

<p>&ldquo;How much jam did you buy?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Three dozen glasses,&rdquo; came the muffled
answer.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo;&mdash;raising her eyes toward
the ceiling in an access of horror. &ldquo;What did
you get so much for? Two or three would
have done. We&rsquo;ll not get through that by
Christmas.&rdquo; There was no answer made to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span>this, and after a moment or two of silence Mrs.
Gault recommenced, in a brisk and unemotional
tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand you at all, Tishy; but I
do know that if you don&rsquo;t stop crying you&rsquo;ll
look a perfect fright at dinner, and everybody
will be wondering what&rsquo;s the matter with you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This appeal to her pride had a good effect
upon Letitia. She struggled with her tears
and finally subdued them. But her flushed and
swollen countenance needed much attention,
and when Mrs. Gault left the room she carried
with her a picture of her sister sitting before
the mirror solicitously dabbing at her eyelids
with a powder-puff.</p>

<p>When she appeared all traces of her previous
distress seemed successfully obliterated. It remained
for the eye of love to penetrate the
restorative processes with which she had doctored
her telltale countenance.</p>

<p>Near the end of dinner Tod McCormick, who
sat beside her, leaned toward her and said, in
the low tone of long-established friendship:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, Tishy? You look sort
of bunged up.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia said nothing was the matter&mdash;why?</p>

<p>The small, red-rimmed eyes of Tod passed
over her face, lingering with the solicitude of
affection upon the delicately pink eyelids and
nostrils.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;You look as if you&rsquo;d been crying,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what a silly idea!&rdquo; answered Letitia,
with a laugh that would have been quite successful
on the stage, but could not deceive the
enamoured Tod; &ldquo;I have a cold.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not that you don&rsquo;t look as pretty as
usual. No matter what you did, you&rsquo;d always
be out o&rsquo; sight. But it just gives me the
willies to think of your being down on your
luck. Honest&mdash;I can&rsquo;t stand it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked away, more to avert her face
from his searching gaze than from embarrassment.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Everybody gets blue now and then,&rdquo; she
said carelessly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you oughtn&rsquo;t to. I&rsquo;m the one that
ought to get blue&mdash;black and blue.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess we all do, more or less.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you&rsquo;d just ease up on the way you keep
giving me the marble heart,&rdquo; continued Tod,
dropping his voice to the key of tenderness,
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d see to it that there&rsquo;d never be a thing to
make you blue. Everything would go your
way. I&rsquo;d see to it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia looked at him with a little vexed
frown.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear me, Tod!&rdquo; she said crossly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re
not going to propose to me here at dinner, are
you, with everybody listening, too?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span></p>

<p>Tod looked round rather guiltily. Letitia
had exaggerated. The only person who appeared
to be noticing them was Mrs. Mortimer
Gault, and her glance immediately slipped
away from his to give the signal for withdrawal
to a lady at the other end of the table.</p>

<h2 id="IV">IV</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE colonel&rsquo;s visits now followed John
Gault&rsquo;s with businesslike regularity. One
week from the afternoon when the younger
man had paid his last call, Colonel Reed had
made his customary appearance and proffered
his customary request.</p>

<p>With each succeeding gift of money his
spirits seemed to rise, his gracious bonhomie
to become more pronounced. Upon this occasion
he had said cheerfully, as he dropped the
pieces of gold into his old chamois-skin purse:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s these unconscionable tradespeople
that eat up our resources! Why can&rsquo;t a provident
government arrange things so that we
don&rsquo;t have to pay butchers and bakers and milkmen?
Life would be so much better worth
while if we could spend our money on clothes
and books and entertaining our friends than in
paying bills. Now, this&rdquo;&mdash;jingling the gold in
the purse&mdash;&ldquo;goes to a son of Belial who sells us
groceries on tick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very kind of him, I should say,&rdquo; said the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span>other. &ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t you rather lucky to have such
good credit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s what I think,&rdquo; said the colonel,
throwing back his head and laughing like an
old prince in whom the joy of life and the desire
of the eyes still burned strong; &ldquo;but Viola
thinks credit is a trap set by the king of all the
devils.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Women are apt to be cautious about that
sort of thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about all women, but Viola is.
She is more afraid of credit than she is of smallpox.
But I say to her: &lsquo;My dear, look where
we would have been without it! And as long
as these good, charitable souls will give us food
and drink for nothing, for goodness&rsquo; sake let
them do it. Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s try and suppress such
a worthy impulse.&rsquo; Not, of course,&rdquo; said the
colonel, growing suddenly grave and squaring
his shoulders, &ldquo;that we don&rsquo;t intend to pay
them. We always do. Sometimes, it is true,
we&rsquo;re rather slow about it; but eventually
things are squared off to everybody&rsquo;s satisfaction.
How else could we have the credit?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He asked this question with an air of triumph
that, to the listener, seemed to have something
in it of conscious cunning. Gault answered
with a commonplace about the advantage of
inspiring so great a trust in the vulgar mind.
The colonel was openly gratified.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; he said, as he moved toward the door,
&ldquo;there&rsquo;s something in the name of Ramsay
Reed yet. But not enough,&rdquo; he added, laughing
with a mischievous appreciation of the
humor of his misfortunes, &ldquo;to let a grocery bill
run on indefinitely. There was a day when
my name was good for any length of time&mdash;but
that was thirty years ago.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Then he left, smiling and happy, and on the
way home bought a pot of pÃ¢tÃ© de foie gras, a
bottle of claret, and a handkerchief with an
embroidered edge for Viola. At the grocery
store on the corner of the street where he lived
he stopped and paid twenty dollars on his bill,
and then fared up the street with rapid strides,
all agog with pleasure at the thought of Viola&rsquo;s
delight in his present, and the jolly little supper
they would have on the end of the kitchen
table.</p>

<p>The man who had made these innocent pleasures
possible was far from enjoying those sensations
of gratification said to be experienced
by a cheerful giver.</p>

<p>He had begun to know very dark hours.
His first great love, come tardily and reluctantly,
at an age when the heart is almost
closed to soft influences and the mind is hardened
with much worldly contact, had come
poisoned with torturing suspicions, with shame
for his own weakness, with fears of the truth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Had he been a stronger man he would have
torn up by the roots this passion for a woman
he dared not trust, have gone away and tried
to forget. But the lifelong habit of self-indulgence
was too powerful to be broken. He did
not want to try and live without the charm and
torment of Viola&rsquo;s presence. Had he been
weaker he would have yielded to the spell,
never dared to question, and gone on blindly
into the purgatory of those who love and doubt.
All his life he had retained an ideal of womanhood&mdash;a
creature aloof from the coarseness of
worldly ambition and vulgar greed. Now he
found himself bound to one the breath of
whose life seemed to be tainted with duplicity
and sordid intrigue.</p>

<p>At times his state of uncertainty became intolerable.
Then he resolved to go to her, take
her hands in his, and looking into her eyes, ask
for the truth. But the world&rsquo;s lessons of a
conventional reserve, a well-bred reticence, asserted
their claims, and he found himself contemplating,
with ironical bitterness, this picture
of his own simplicity. If they were deceiving
him, how they would laugh&mdash;laugh together&mdash;at
the folly of the pigeon they were plucking so
cleverly! A life&rsquo;s experience, caution, cynicism,
had gone down into dust before a girl&rsquo;s
gray eyes. Could she be false and those eyes
look into his so frankly and honestly? Could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>those lips, that folded on each other in curves
so full of innocence and truth, be ready with
words of hypocrisy and deceit? When he was
with her such thoughts seemed madness; when
he was away from her his belief seemed a miserable
infatuation.</p>

<p>After the colonel&rsquo;s last appearance he again
determined to try and see her alone. This, he
discovered, was not as easy of accomplishment
as it had been on his first attempt. Arriving
at the house at four o&rsquo;clock, he rang repeatedly,
but was not able to gain admittance. At
last a small boy, who had been studying him
through the bars of the gate, volunteered the
information that the lady was out.</p>

<p>Gault turned away, and coming down the
flagged walk, asked the child if he knew what
direction she had taken.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I dunno that,&rdquo; said the boy, &ldquo;but she went
out with her basket, and when she goes with
her basket she generally stays a long while.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault rewarded him for his information with
a piece of money, and turned down the street
toward the other side of town.</p>

<p>It was a windy afternoon. The trades were
just beginning, and their clear, chill sweep had
already borne away some of the evil odors
which hung about the old portion of the city.
Gault could feel the touch of fog in their buoyant
breath, and knew that long tongues of it
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span>like white wool were stealing in through the
Golden Gate. The city was putting on its
summer aspect&mdash;a gray glare, softened by the
mingling of dust and haze that rode the breezes.
Bits of paper, rags, and straws were collected
at corners in little whirling heaps. Presently
the mightier winds would come, winging their
way across miles of heaving seas to rush down
the street in a mad carouse, carrying before
them the dirt and refuse and odors and uncleanness
which mark the dwelling of man.</p>

<p>He had walked some distance when, rounding
a corner, a sharp gust seized him. In its
fierce exultation it threw a whirlwind of dust
into his eyes, so that, for a moment, he did not
see that she was coming toward him. Then he
caught a glimpse of the approaching figure and
recognized it. She did not see him, but was
engaged in her customary amusement of looking
into the gardens. There was an air of
unmistakable alertness and gaiety about her.
Her hand tapped the tops of the fence-rails as
she came, and she looked at the floral display
behind them with happy eyes. Her scanty
black skirt was sometimes whirled round her
feet, showing her small ankles and narrow russet
shoes. Once she had to put up her hand
to her hat,&mdash;a white sailor bound with a dark
ribbon,&mdash;and the frolicsome wind swept all the
loosened ends of her hair forward and lashed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>her skirts out on either side. She had a basket
on one arm, and holding this firmly, leaned
back almost on the wind, laughing to herself.</p>

<p>At the same moment she caught sight of him.
The wind dropped suddenly, as if conscious
that she should not be presented in such boisterous
guise to a lover&rsquo;s eye, and her figure
seemed to fall back into lines of decorous demureness;
only the color and laughter of her
recent buffeting still remained in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it you?&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Did you see me in
the wind? Isn&rsquo;t it fun?&rdquo;</p>

<p>They met, and he took her hand. She was
all blown about, but fresh as a flower that has
shaken off the dew. The contrast between
them, between what might be called their different
ranks in society, was much more clearly
marked in the open light of the street than in
the ragged homeliness of her own parlor.</p>

<p>While he was essentially the man of luxurious
environment and assured position, she presented
the appearance of a working-girl. Even
the delicacy and refinement of her face could
not counteract the suggestion of her dress.
Beauty when unadorned may adorn the most,
but it cannot give to ill-made old clothes the
effect of garments made by a French modiste.
John Gault was used to women who wore this
kind of clothes&mdash;so used, in fact, that he hardly
knew what made Viola appear so different from
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>the other girls of his acquaintance. The contrast
in their looks seemed to mark more clearly
the contrast in their positions, seemed to purposely
accentuate that wide gulf set between
them.</p>

<p>Gault took her basket from her and dropped
into place at her side. The high rows of houses
protected them from the wind, and only as they
crossed the open spaces at the intersection of
streets did it catch them, and, for a moment,
play boisterously with them.</p>

<p>The girl seemed in excellent spirits. He had
noticed this with every recurring visit. Looking
back upon her as she was when he had first
known her, care-worn, pale, and quiet, she
seemed now like a different person. Her glance
sparkled with animation, her voice was full of
that thrilling quality which some women&rsquo;s voices
acquire in moments of happiness. She was a
hundred times more fatally alluring than she
had been in the beginning. He knew now that
while he was with her his reason would always
be in abeyance to his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You seem to be in very good spirits,&rdquo; he
said to her, not without a feeling of personal
grievance that some cause of which he was
ignorant should add so to her lightness of heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in very good
spirits. I&rsquo;m quite happy. It&rsquo;s something
lovely to feel so gay in your heart, isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; maybe I&rsquo;ve never felt so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, what nonsense!&rdquo; she cried, looking at
him reproachfully. &ldquo;You, who have always
had just what you wanted! I used to be afraid
of you at first. It seemed rather awful to
know anybody who&rsquo;d always had things go
exactly their way.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ignored the remark and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s making you happy? Tell it to
me, and then perhaps I&rsquo;ll get a little reflection
of it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s any one especial
thing. Happiness comes when lots of little
things fit nicely together. I never had one big
thing in a lump to make me happy. I tell you
what&rsquo;s doing a good deal toward it. Father
and I are&rdquo;&mdash;she made an instant&rsquo;s pause and
then said&mdash;&ldquo;doing so much better; financially,
I mean. It&rsquo;s such a relief! You don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and looked at her and met her
eyes. They looked rather abashed, and then
fell away from the scrutiny of his.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think it queer of me to tell you
that, do you?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;I tell you a good
many things I wouldn&rsquo;t say to other people.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I am proud that you should have such confidence
in me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she continued, with a quick sigh of
relief, &ldquo;we&rsquo;ve been lately&mdash;that is, just about
when we first knew you, and before that&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>really
quite badly off. And my father being
so sanguine, and having once been so differently
situated, it&rsquo;s very hard on him&mdash;very
hard.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She paused, and he felt that she was looking
at him for confirmation of her remark.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very; I quite understand,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And, really, it was dreadful. It&rsquo;s trying
for old people&mdash;so much anxiety. And then,
just at the very worst, things suddenly brightened.
Just about a month or six weeks ago
the luck changed. You must have been the
mascot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>This time he looked at her, but her glance
was averted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; he said, thinking that his voice
sounded strange.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because it was after we knew you that
things began to get better. I was angry with
my father that first day when he asked you in,
because I didn&rsquo;t want you to see how&mdash;how
straitened we were. There&rsquo;s a pride of poverty,
you know; well, I suppose I must have a little
bit of it. Everything was at its worst then.
But now it&rsquo;s all different. You&rsquo;ve been the
mascot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He again felt her eyes surveying him, but
found it impossible to look at her. In his heart
he was afraid of what he might read in her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you like being a mascot?&rdquo; she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>queried, in her happy girl&rsquo;s voice. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t
look as if you did.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m proud and flattered, probably too much
so for speech.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad, because that&rsquo;s what you were.
There&rsquo;s no getting out of it. I&rsquo;ll tell you how
it happened. My father used to own a great
deal of stock in mines and companies and
things, and when everything went down so fast,
he sold almost all of it. But some he kept.
He had it put away in the drawers of his desk
up-stairs in his room, and about two months
ago it began to go up, and now it pays dividends
and we get them. Isn&rsquo;t that good luck?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She was close to him, looking into his face.
He turned his head this time and confronted
her with a steady gaze. In the harsh afternoon
light every curve and line of her countenance
was revealed. Her eyes were full of light and
joy. His glance met and held them for one
searching moment, then turned away baffled.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very good luck. I congratulate you,&rdquo; he
said.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You may well,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d given
up expecting good luck ever any more in this
world. I believe in it, and my father&rsquo;s had
come and gone almost before I was born, and
mine&mdash;mine hasn&rsquo;t come yet, I suppose.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Unless you discover some more old stock
in the pigeonholes of the desk.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s likely. Lightning
doesn&rsquo;t strike twice in the same place.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What was the stock? Mining stock?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She seemed in doubt for a moment, then said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I think so&mdash;yes, surely, mining stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you remember the name of the mine?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He glanced at her as she walked beside him.
She appeared to be cogitating.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t believe I do,&rdquo; she answered at length.
&ldquo;To tell you the truth, I don&rsquo;t believe my
father mentioned it to me. I&rsquo;m very stupid
about business. I&rsquo;ve never had any necessity
to know about it, and so I&rsquo;ve never learned.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How long had it been lying in the desk?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, years and years! Probably twenty.
It was a relic of the days when everything was
booming.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s been paying assessments on it all
these years, he ought certainly to be repaid
now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was scrutinizing her sharply. Her profile
was toward him, and at this remark he saw the
color mount into her cheek, and that curious
appearance of immobility come over her face
which denotes a sudden, almost electric stoppage
and then concentration of mental activity.
She raised her head and said, without looking
at him:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Assessments are a yearly or semi-yearly
payment, aren&rsquo;t they?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, or quarterly&mdash;according to the way
the stock is drawn.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t there some that is non-assessable?
I&rsquo;ve surely heard that expression.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;In other States, but in California&mdash;well,
possibly there might be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure there must be. This of my father&rsquo;s
must have been.&rdquo; She came quite close
to him in her earnestness, and looked at him
with an expression of uneasiness on her face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It must have been that kind,&rdquo; she insisted;
&ldquo;probably you never heard of this mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Probably I never did,&rdquo; he answered grimly.</p>

<p>They walked on for a few moments in silence.
There was a visible drop in her spirits. Stealing
a side glance at her, he could see that she
was looking down, evidently in troubled
thought. Suddenly she raised her head and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I don&rsquo;t really know anything about it.
Only I do hope one thing, and that is that it
will go on paying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t bother about that,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it will.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think it will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned on her roughly and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think it will?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to think so,&rdquo; she answered, abashed
by his unusual manner; &ldquo;but I&rsquo;ve learned that
it&rsquo;s foolish to hope. I try not to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave a short, disagreeable laugh and said:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, not in this case. Hope as much as
you like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re very cheering,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but
I don&rsquo;t see how you can be so sure.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It seems to me you&rsquo;re very pessimistic&mdash;especially
for a young woman who has just
found a drawerful of paying stock.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His manner in making this remark was so
impregnated with angry bitterness that Viola,
chilled and repelled, made no response. In silence
they walked onward till a turn in the
street brought them in sight of the house.</p>

<p>At the gate she said rather timidly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Would you like to come in?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He had been carrying the basket, and now
found the depositing of it in a place of safety
an excuse to enter; for even in his present state
of morose ill humor he could not forego the
pleasure of a few more moments of her society.</p>

<p>In the cold, half-furnished house their footsteps
echoed with a strangely solitary effect.
She preceded him into the parlor, and moved
about with the confident tread of the chatelaine,
pulling up the blinds, putting the basket out of
sight, and laying aside her hat and gloves.
There were some thin flowered muslin curtains
hanging over the bay-window, and she arranged
the folds of these with deft, proprietary
touches, and then stepped back and studied
the effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>After watching her for a moment the visitor
said in a tone of restored amiability:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Aren&rsquo;t those something new?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with quick, grateful recognition
of his change of mood.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes; do you like them? I changed my
mind about a dozen times before I bought
them. Even now I don&rsquo;t know whether I&rsquo;m
entirely satisfied.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, you ought to be,&rdquo; he said, as he drew
near and eyed the curtains with the air of a
connoisseur; &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sure you couldn&rsquo;t have
chosen anything prettier.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola&rsquo;s spirits rose to the level they had been
at when he met her earlier in the afternoon.
Her eyes brightened and her face took on its
most animated expression.</p>

<p>&ldquo;They&rsquo;re another outward and visible sign
of the rise in mining stock,&rdquo; she continued.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m so glad you noticed them without my
having to make you do so.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to know why I did?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because they were pretty, of course.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not at all. I was looking at you as you
arranged them, and wondering why a pair of
curtains should be so much more interesting
than I was.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What made you think they were?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because you were devoting yourself to
them and coldly ignoring me.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;That was because I was a little bit frightened
of you. You were so cross just now, before we
came in, that I didn&rsquo;t know what to say to
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I cross? What a calumny! I was in my
sweetest humor.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him mischievously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If you call that your sweetest humor, all I
can think is that you&rsquo;re not as clever as you
pretend to be.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m afraid I&rsquo;m not. For example, I&rsquo;m
not clever enough to understand you&mdash;a little
girl like you, scarcely half my age.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Am I really such a sphinx?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You are to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I like that,&rdquo; she said, smiling, and gathering
up the edge of the curtain in a frill; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want everybody to see through me. But
you&rsquo;re different.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How am I different?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;re more a friend than other people&mdash;more
a friend than anybody else I know. Tell
me what you don&rsquo;t understand about me, and
I&rsquo;ll explain it. I won&rsquo;t leave myself a single
secret.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though he was standing close to her, looking
down at her, he suddenly dropped his voice to
the key that was the lowest she could hear.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I only dared to ask, and you would only
tell the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Dared to ask!&rdquo; she repeated blankly,
alarmed and upset by his singular change of
manner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And you would tell the truth,&rdquo; he added,
and heard his own voice sound suddenly husky
and shaken. &ldquo;Tell it to me now!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I always do,&rdquo; she stammered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No matter what it is,&rdquo; he continued, as if
he had not heard her&mdash;&ldquo;no matter how it may
hurt me or injure you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The color ran over her face and as quickly
ebbed away, leaving her pallid. It might have
been the confession of innocence or the confusion
of guilt. She looked nervously from side
to side, raised her eyes to his, and dropped them
again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There are always a few things a person
can&rsquo;t tell,&rdquo; she almost whispered.</p>

<p>He gave an ugly laugh, and put his arm half
round her as if to draw her to him, then drew
back as quickly, and turning away, walked to
the window. Viola did not seem to have noticed
the attempted caress. There was a moment
of penetrating silence. He wondered if
she could hear his heart beat.</p>

<p>Then she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why do you say such strange things? I
always tell you the truth.&rdquo;</p>

<p>To his listening ear her voice sounded affectedly
naÃ¯ve. He answered without moving:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course you do. So do all women since
the days of Eve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you don&rsquo;t seem to believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t jump at such hasty conclusions.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you heard anything about me that
would make you think I was deceitful?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have never spoken of you to any one
except your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t understand you at all to-day.
You&rsquo;re so changeable and moody, and sometimes
so ill-humored.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a dreadful afternoon you&rsquo;ve had!
I&rsquo;m sorry.&rdquo; Then, with an abrupt change of
tone: &ldquo;Who picks up the leaves of the deodar
and ties them up in those neat little bundles?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do&mdash;do you believe me?&rdquo; She spoke
with a sharpness he had never heard her use
before.</p>

<p>He broke out into sudden laughter that this
time sounded genuine. Turning from the window,
he came toward her and took her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you angry?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder.
Say the most disagreeable things you
can think of, and they won&rsquo;t be more than I
deserve.&rdquo;</p>

<p>For the second time this afternoon she
beamed over his restoration to good humor.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m not a very good person to quarrel
with,&rdquo; she said, looking at him with soft, for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>giving
eyes, &ldquo;though, as you see, I&rsquo;ve got a
temper.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave her hand a little pressure and relinquished
it, taking up his hat.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Accept a hundred apologies from me for
my rudeness. Good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You <i>were</i> disagreeable,&rdquo; she admitted, as
they went together into the hall. &ldquo;You
seemed as if you didn&rsquo;t believe half I said
to you, and actually as if our good luck made
you angry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault had opened the door, and his face was
turned from her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t think that,&rdquo; he answered, as he
stepped out on to the porch; &ldquo;whatever gives
you happiness adds to mine. Adios, seÃ±orita.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The door closed after him, and Viola stood
alone in the hall, smiling to herself. She made
as if to watch him through one of the narrow
panes of glass which formed small windows on
either side of the portal, then suddenly drew
back and shook her head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That would be bad luck,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m too happy to risk bad luck.&rdquo;</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">It</span> was a few days later than this that an opera
company of some fame in southern France was
encouraged by a successful Mexican season to
run up to San Francisco. Californians are notoriously
fond of music, and the small opera
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span>companies which wander through the West,
not daring to measure their talents with the
Eastern stars, generally can count on a profitable
season by the Golden Gate. Bad scenery,
absurd costumes, and indifferent acting do not
damp the ardor of the Californian, who will go
anywhere and undergo any small discomfort
to hear passable singing.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gault, who went every year or two to
New York and found her ideas there, as she did
her hats and dresses, derided the local taste for
hearing unknown prima donnas as Leonora
and Gilda. But her husband and Letitia overruled
her in at least this one particular, and
when opera came up from Mexico or across
from New Orleans, she always went with them,
and tried to look as bored as her animated features
and lively style would permit.</p>

<p>This particular season, a short one of three
weeks given by an Italian company that had
been touring Mexico during the winter, opened
with a performance of &ldquo;Rigoletto.&rdquo; For the
first night Mortimer Gault procured one of the
lower boxes, leaving it to his wife to fill it with
such company as she desired, provided a seat was
left for him in the background, where he could
hear and would not have to talk. The party,
which consisted of Mr. and Mrs. Gault, Letitia,
John, Tod McCormick, and his sister Pearl,
was late in arriving, and it was not until the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>interval between the second and third acts that
they found time to look about the house. Letitia
and Pearl were in the front of the box, the
latter on the inner side nearest the audience,
with John Gault sitting behind her in the
shadow of the curtain. While Letitia looked
about the house through her lorgnon she could
hear the animated chatter of Pearl, interspersed
with comments from Maud Gault and
Tod.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you see that woman in the box opposite&mdash;the
pale one with the piece of blue velvet
twisted in her hair? She came up with the
company, and her husband is a professional
gambler in Mexico and makes heaps of money.
You can ask Tod if you don&rsquo;t believe me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod said it was all true, and that she was a
&ldquo;peach,&rdquo; a form of encomium that, in his vast
appreciation, he was fond of applying to every
member of the other sex that came within
range of his admiring eye.</p>

<p>&ldquo;In the box above, where the two good-looking
men are, that little red, squeezed-looking
woman is Lady Jervis, who used to be Tiny
Madison ever so long ago. She went abroad
and married Sir Somebody or other Jervis,
and she&rsquo;s out here now with a syndicate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is she doing with a syndicate?&rdquo; Mrs.
Gault asked. &ldquo;Is she going on the stage?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; they&rsquo;re buying mines or railroads or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span>something. Her husband&rsquo;s in it, and all the
others, they say, are English lords. That&rsquo;s
part of the syndicate with her now, in the
box.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What part of the syndicate?&rdquo; said Tod.
&ldquo;The head, or the feet, or the middle?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t get gay, Tod,&rdquo; said his sister, severely;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like small boys when they&rsquo;re too
funny. Down there in the audience, near the
middle of the parquet, is the woman whose
husband is something or other in Central
America. He&rsquo;s enormously rich, and she
comes up here once a year and buys clothes.
They say she used to be on the stage, and she
looks just like it; she has such a lot of paint
round her eyes and such vaudeville hair. But
you ought to see her children! They&rsquo;re quite
black, just like little negroes. Major Conway,
who lived down there a good deal, says that
Central American children are all dark when
they&rsquo;re young, and then it wears off as they
grow older.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do they use sapolio?&rdquo; inquired Tod.</p>

<p>Pearl treated this inquiry with fitting scorn,
and continued:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s Bertha Lajaune, over there by the
pillar. Do you think she&rsquo;s so beautiful? I
must say I don&rsquo;t. I heard the other day that
she was a Jewess, and that her mother had one
of those pawnbroking places south of Market
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>Street, and that they&rsquo;d only just moved away
a few years when she married old Marcel Lajaune.&rdquo;</p>

<p>As Pearl rattled on thus, assisted by Tod and
Mrs. Gault, Letitia let her lorgnon follow on
the track of their comments, idly passing from
face to face as their light talk touched on it.</p>

<p>She looked curiously at the wife of the Mexican
gambler, a romantically handsome woman,
with a skin like a magnolia-petal, and a frame
of ebony hair setting off a face of Madonna-like
softness. The lady in the box above was not
pretty at all, Letitia thought. She had a broad,
good-humored red face, an impudent nose,
and a frizz of blond hair crimped far down on
her forehead in the English fashion. Her black
evening dress showed a section of white neck,
and a piece of reddened arm was visible between
her short sleeves and the edge of her
long gloves. Letitia had been too young to remember
her as Tiny Madison, and wondered
how a Californian could come to look so like a
British princess.</p>

<p>The Central American lady was much more
interesting. She was like a lily among the
gipsy-looking dark women and small, beady-eyed
men of her suite. She was thin, pale, and
haggard, with artificially reddened hair and
heavy eyelids much painted. Her eyes from
under these looked out with an air of languid
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>world-weariness. She had some immense diamonds
round her throat, and the fan she lazily
moved twinkled with them.</p>

<p>Letitia studied her for some interested minutes,
then passed on to Bertha Lajaune, of
whom everybody had heard and most people
were talking. She was accounted by many the
most beautiful woman in San Francisco, and
had risen from an unpenetrated obscurity by
her marriage with a rich French wine merchant.
Letitia disagreed with Pearl. She thought
Mme. Lajaune quite as beautiful as people said
she was. To-night, in a gorgeous toilet of
pale lavender with a good deal of silver and
lace about it, she had the appearance of an ennuyÃ©d
princess. Her pale skin, classic features,
and large light eyes, with an extraordinarily
wide sweep of lid, seemed to stamp her as one
designed by nature to wear a crown. Letitia
was about to turn and draw John Gault&rsquo;s attention
to her, when the lorgnon, in its transit,
suddenly commanded two faces just below&mdash;Colonel
Reed&rsquo;s and Viola&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>They were not looking her way, and Letitia
riveted the glass on them. The colonel was
sitting up and looking about alertly. He was
instinct with life, enjoyment, and animation.
With his neck craned out of his collar, he was
surveying the audience, now and then turning
to impart some hasty comment to Viola. He
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>had the eager, happy air of a man who is in
his element.</p>

<p>Viola was sitting back rather listlessly, with
her hands clasped in her lap. She was dressed
simply but prettily in gray, and wore no hat.
The color was the one most perfectly suited
to harmonize with her eyes and hair. Among
the handsome and well-dressed women that
surrounded her, she preserved the same suggestion
of distinction and superiority that Letitia
had recognized when she saw her in her
own ragged drawing-room.</p>

<p>Holding out the glass, Letitia turned to Gault,
who was sitting silent in the shelter of the curtain,
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Reed&rsquo;s sitting down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He gave the slightest possible start, and
moving forward, looked in the direction she
indicated.</p>

<p>&ldquo;So he is,&rdquo; he said in an uninterested tone,
&ldquo;and with his daughter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Unfortunately, Tod McCormick, who had
drawn up as close to Letitia as his chair would
permit, heard this short dialogue and pricked
up his ears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Colonel Reed,&rdquo; he said vivaciously, &ldquo;and
his daughter? Where?&rdquo;</p>

<p>He bent forward, his lean neck stretched out,
his weazened visage full of a curiosity that was
only naÃ¯vely boyish, but that on his ugly and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>insignificant features acquired a mean and disagreeable
air.</p>

<p>&ldquo;By gracious!&rdquo; he said, after surveying the
colonel with a knowing grin. &ldquo;At the opera,
in the best seats, dressed like the lilies of the
field&mdash;oh, you old rascal!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He wagged his head at the colonel with a
look of wicked knowledge that he was extremely
fond of assuming.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; said Letitia, twisting
round on her chair so that she could see him.
&ldquo;What makes you call him a rascal?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, old rogue! old rogue!&rdquo; repeated Tod,
as though he had secret and masonic intelligence
of serious misdeeds in the colonel&rsquo;s
past. &ldquo;And that&rsquo;s his daughter? Ain&rsquo;t she a
peach!&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Gault moved uneasily and looked back
into the shadows of the box. Letitia, feeling
uncomfortable, said hurriedly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, indeed. She&rsquo;s prettier than anybody
here, I think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Except you, Tishy,&rdquo; said Tod, but, it must
be admitted, in an absent tone. He leaned
farther forward, his eyes on the girl in the seat
below, the smile on his face changing from one
of whimsical malice to the slow, pleased grin of
affected admiration.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, she can draw my salary! She can
have the key of my trunk!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Have you ever seen her before?&rdquo; asked
Letitia.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, but I&rsquo;ve heard of her. Everybody&rsquo;s
heard of her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very odd; I never did till the other day.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You mightn&rsquo;t have. The boys, I mean.
All of a sudden, every feller&rsquo;s begun askin&rsquo;
every other feller if he knows Colonel Reed&rsquo;s
daughter. She&rsquo;s sort of in the air, like
microbes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should she be?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod shrugged.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, a girl as pretty as that can&rsquo;t be expected
to blush unseen down in South Park
forever.&rdquo;</p>

<p>John Gault rose suddenly and went to the
back of the box, where he joined his brother,
who was silently digesting his pleasure in the
music. Tod, quite unconscious of any offense,
was glad to be left in sole possession of Letitia,
and rambled on, repeating tag-ends of gossip
that had lodged in his shallow brain.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The colonel&rsquo;s a great old chap. He likes
the &lsquo;long green.&rsquo; He once had plenty of it,
and once you get the habit of having it, it&rsquo;s
worse than morphine to get cured of. The
colonel ain&rsquo;t got cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He hasn&rsquo;t got a cent,&rdquo; said Letitia, &ldquo;so I
don&rsquo;t see but that he&rsquo;s got to get cured.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s two good ways of getting money
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>when you ain&rsquo;t got it&mdash;just two,&rdquo; said Tod,
oracularly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And what are those?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stealing and borrowing. And if you steal
you know there&rsquo;s always a risk about being an
expense to your country; and no self-respecting
man wants that. But borrowing! Get a
good, quiet, peaceable victim,&mdash;the kind that
don&rsquo;t make a fuss, likes to have his leg pulled,
thrives on it, misses it when you leave off,&mdash;and
you&rsquo;re on velvet. I should judge the colonel
had found just the right kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What a horrid thing to say, Tod!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Horrid! The colonel doesn&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s
horrid. I wonder who he&rsquo;s corralled. Three
years ago he took hold of my father. It was
great, the way he worked the old man. You
know, people haven&rsquo;t been able to trace Jerry
McCormick through life by the quarters he&rsquo;s
dropped. It did my heart good to see the way
the colonel managed him. I guess he must
have got nearly a thou&rsquo; out of him before my
father shut down.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I shouldn&rsquo;t think his daughter would like
that,&rdquo; said Letitia, feeling a chill at her heart.</p>

<p>Tod raised his eyebrows and pursed his lips.
His faith in the pride and fine feelings of young
women who were poor did not appear strong.
But in spite of his assumption of a blasÃ© cynicism,
he was a kindly soul at heart.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, she mightn&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it&rsquo;s so
easy to fool women.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia was silent for a moment. Then she
commented, as if speaking to herself:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose it would be easy for her father to
fool her?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Easy as lying.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you suppose he borrows that way from
other men?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tod directed upon her an incredulous side
glance. Then, meeting the anxious inquiry of
her eyes, he broke into a broad smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I should snicker,&rdquo; he said, in an
amused tone.</p>

<p>The curtain rose here, and further dialogue
was cut off, for Letitia was a lover of singing,
and when the music began again, sank into a rapt
and immovable silence. During the other entr&rsquo;actes
the conversation was general, and any
more confidences on the subject of Colonel
Reed and his daughter were impossible.</p>

<p>In the foyer, on the way out, the party became
scattered. Crowds surging from the
main aisle pressed forward and separated Mrs.
Gault, her husband, and Pearl McCormick from
the other three, who had stopped in an angle
of space near the stairway for Letitia to adjust
her cloak. As Gault was shaking it out preparatory
to laying it across her shoulders, her
attention was caught by the figures of Colonel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>Reed and Viola, who emerged from the entrance
of a side aisle just in front of them.</p>

<p>The colonel&rsquo;s eye fell on Gault, his face
beamed with recognition and pleasure, and, with
a word to Viola, he started forward to greet
him. Viola gave a vexed exclamation and
caught him by the arm, evidently with the intention
of deterring him. But the old man,
flushed with the excitement of once more finding
himself in the familiar scenes of light and
revelry, seized her hand, and, drawing her with
him, came forward. Viola, thus forcibly overruled,
advanced, her face full of distressed
embarrassment.</p>

<p>Gault, who had been occupied with the cloak,
had not seen this little pantomime, and the
first intimation he had of the colonel&rsquo;s proximity
was his loud and patronizing greeting. He
turned quickly and saw the old man, bland and
majestic as ever, and beside him Viola, pained
and uncomfortable, the object of Tod&rsquo;s admiring
stares, and only too plainly dragged forward
by her ill-inspired father. His face
flushed with annoyance, aroused alike by the
false position in which the girl was placed, and
by the revelation thus made to Letitia that he
had not been frank when he had led her to believe
that he did not know Colonel Reed&rsquo;s
daughter.</p>

<p>His indignation found expression in his cold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>and almost curt reply to the colonel&rsquo;s greeting.
There was no mistaking its import. It spoke
so plainly of annoyance that even the easy affability
of the old man was disturbed. He looked
taken aback, and for a moment evidently did
not know what to say. Tod looked from one
man to the other, grinning at the embarrassment
of a situation he did not understand. For
a moment there was a most disagreeable pause.
Letitia knew that recognition would betray the
fact that she had met Viola, but the mortification
of the girl&rsquo;s position made her bold.</p>

<p>&ldquo;How do you do, Miss Reed?&rdquo; she said; and
then, as a brilliant afterthought, &ldquo;Do you like
music?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Very much,&rdquo; Viola managed to answer;
&ldquo;and it was good, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was A1,&rdquo; said Tod, not by any means
intending to be left out; &ldquo;and that prima
donna, ain&rsquo;t she a peach?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mme. Foedor is a lovely Gilda. She looks
so young. Most of them are too old and matronly,&rdquo;
continued Letitia, fastening the clasps of
her cloak, and wondering if this exceedingly uncomfortable
conversation was to be prolonged.</p>

<p>Viola&rsquo;s reply put an end to her uneasiness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lovely! I never saw her before, or the
opera, either. But we must go. Father, we&rsquo;ll
miss the car if we don&rsquo;t hurry. Good night.
Good night, Mr. Gault.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span></p>

<p>She took the old man by the arm and tried
to draw him toward the side entrance. But the
vision of Letitia in all the glory of evening dress
had been the last touch to the colonel&rsquo;s enjoyment
on this momentous evening. He seemed
to have forgotten the repulse he had just received,
and hung back from his daughter&rsquo;s persuasive
hand, looking with courtly admiration
at Miss Mason. She was keen enough to see
that he would again overrule his daughter and
add further to the embarrassment of the meeting,
and sweeping her cloak round her, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;We must go too, or we&rsquo;ll never find the
others. Good night.&rdquo; And with a little smiling
nod she turned with her attendant cavaliers
and plunged into the crowd.</p>

<p>Tod, squeezing along beside her in the throng,
said querulously:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you introduce me? I&rsquo;d have
given that old man a song and dance, and he&rsquo;d
have asked me down there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But Gault, on her other side, said nothing.
Once, as the crowd jostled her against him, she
stole a glance in his direction, and found him
looking away with frowning brows and a morose
expression. She wondered if he had realized
that her remarks to Viola indicated a
previous acquaintance. If he had he would
certainly be angry with her.</p>

<p>Pearl and Tod were dropped on the way
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span>back, but Gault drove home with the others.
He said he had been suffering from insomnia
lately, and a walk would tire him out. Once in
the house, Mortimer led him back into the dining-room
to try a new wine that had been made
on the vineyard of a mutual friend. Letitia
and Maud were left alone in the drawing-room,
where the former, expressing fatigue, threw herself
down in a long chair, and the latter moved
about turning down lamps, and here and there
arranging with a housewife&rsquo;s hand the disarray
of tumbled cushions and carelessly disposed
draperies. Finally she passed out of the room,
and Letitia, still sitting where she had dropped,
heard her skirts rustling softly as she ascended
the stairway.</p>

<p>Letitia did not move. She wanted to see
John before he left. If he had noticed her
greeting of Viola Reed he would undoubtedly
speak of it, and she would be given a chance to
explain. With any other man but John it
would have been nothing. But John was so
peculiar, so reserved about his own affairs, so
resentful, so terribly resentful, of anything like
intrusion or interference. Letitia as she waited
felt, much to her own surprise, that she was
growing nervous, that her heart was beginning
to beat uncomfortably hard and her breath to
come uncomfortably short.</p>

<p>Suddenly she heard his voice, in the room be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>yond,
bidding Mortimer good night. She sat
up quickly, and then as quickly looked down so
as to give her figure the air of repose and indifference
which was so far from her state of
mind. He entered the room, and seeing her,
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Tishy, are you still there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The tone of his voice struck on her ear as
singularly cold and aloof. Her nervousness
increased, for she sincerely feared his anger.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;wanted to
speak to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What had you to say?&rdquo; he asked, stopping
before her, but not sitting down.</p>

<p>It did not occur to her, in her state of trepidation,
that the obvious abstraction and coldness
of his manner might be the result of causes
that she did not know. She at once leaped to
the conclusion that he had realized she had
made Viola&rsquo;s acquaintance in some underhand
way, and that he was now bitterly incensed
with her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wanted to explain to you how&mdash;how&mdash;I
came to know Viola Reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The remark dispelled all his indifference in
an instant. The sudden concentrating of his
attention upon her in a piercing look and a
sharp, penetrating fixity of observation added
a hundredfold to Letitia&rsquo;s agitation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;knew you&rsquo;d be angry and probably
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>misunderstand. You&rsquo;re always so&mdash;so reticent
and queer about your own affairs. I didn&rsquo;t see
any harm in trying to know Miss Reed. It
was better, anyway, than letting Maud go, and
she was so set upon it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia raised her eyes pleadingly, then
dropped them quickly. His were blazing. But
it was too late to go back now. He took a
chair, drew it up before her, and sat down.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just explain to me what you mean,&rdquo; he said
quietly. &ldquo;You and Maud have been trying to
make the acquaintance of Miss Reed&mdash;is that
it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We did more than try. We did it&mdash;I did
it. I wouldn&rsquo;t let Maud. I was afraid she&rsquo;d
do something. Maud sometimes hasn&rsquo;t got
as much tact&mdash;as much tact as she ought to
have.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;How did you do it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I just went there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went there? You went into that lady&rsquo;s
house&mdash;intruded, without invitation or acquaintance&mdash;forced
your way in as if you were a
peddler? I can&rsquo;t believe that of you, Letitia.
You had some excuse for going there.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia rose to her feet. She did it unconsciously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t exactly intrude; though I&rsquo;ll tell
you the truth, John&mdash;I&rsquo;ll not hide anything. I
do think it was mean. I thought it after I got
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>in and saw how&mdash;how poor and miserable everything
was. I felt mortified at what I&rsquo;d done.
I wouldn&rsquo;t have gone in the beginning if I&rsquo;d
thought it was as bad as that. But I had an
excuse. I bought jam and four plants. That&rsquo;s
one of them on the stand.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Bought jam and plants! What are you
talking about? I don&rsquo;t understand you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sells them,&mdash;jam and plants,&mdash;and I
bought three dozen pots and four plants.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You went there and bought these things
from her in her own house?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; Letitia answered, and went on helplessly,
in order to say something: &ldquo;Four plants
for two dollars. It was very cheap.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment&rsquo;s pause. Then the man
said in a suppressed voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You patronized her in her poverty&mdash;pried
into her home, bought things from her, gave
her money! Good God!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He dropped his voice and turned away, unable
to finish. Letitia came toward him. She
knew that in this interview the happiness of
her life was at stake, and yet that she must be
true to herself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did give her money, but not as you mean.
I was sorry for her and wanted to help her. I
wouldn&rsquo;t have hurt her any more than you
would. It was because of you I went there.
It was because we heard you were so interested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>in her. But after I got there I was ashamed
and sorry, and I tried not to make her feel
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So you gave her two dollars for four plants!
It takes a woman to know how to humiliate a
woman!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I saw she wasn&rsquo;t the kind of person Maud
thought she was,&rdquo; continued Letitia, going
blindly on. &ldquo;I was certain they made a mistake
in saying the things they did about her.
Even if you were giving them money, even if
you were supporting them, she wasn&rsquo;t that
kind.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who told you I was supporting them?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;people say it. And
maybe I did do her an injustice in going there
and spying on her, as you say. But you are
the one who has done her a real injustice&mdash;the
kind of injustice that hurts.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I!&rdquo; he exclaimed, too surprised to defend
himself. &ldquo;What have I done?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve kept it all so secret that you made
people think there was something wrong about
it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letitia,&rdquo; he cried, in a tone of warning,
&ldquo;take care! You&rsquo;ve meddled enough already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You hid away your friendship with her as
if it were shameful. You acted as if you were
ashamed of her and of your knowing her&mdash;as if
there was something wicked about her, so you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>couldn&rsquo;t even speak of her to me or any other
woman that you knew well. When I asked you
about her, though you were too much of a man
of honor to tell me a lie, you were not too
much of a man of honor to act one. You gave
her father money, but you were ashamed to
acknowledge that you even knew her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve had enough of this conversation,&rdquo; he
said, now trembling with rage. &ldquo;Let it end.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned to leave the room, but Letitia&rsquo;s
voice arrested him, and he stood with his back
to her, listening.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have known enough to trust
her,&rdquo; she continued desperately, for she was
singing the swan-song of her hopes. &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve
only got to look into her face to see what she
is. No matter what people say about her and
her father, no matter what silly stories are repeated,
even if there <i>were</i> other men who gave
the colonel money&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Letitia stopped. Gault had wheeled suddenly
round upon her, and the expression of
his face made the words die on her lips.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Other men!&rdquo; he repeated. &ldquo;Who said that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod,&rdquo; she faltered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who were they?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;don&rsquo;t know; he didn&rsquo;t tell their
names.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What did he say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He said&mdash;he said&mdash;&rdquo; she stammered, bewil<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>dered
by her own pain and sympathy for his
obvious suffering. &ldquo;No, it was I. I asked
him if the colonel got money from other men,
and he&mdash;he didn&rsquo;t say much; he laughed and
said, &lsquo;Well, I should snicker!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; answered Gault, in a low voice.
&ldquo;Good night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He turned and left the room, and a moment
later the hall door closed behind him with a
muffled bang.</p>

<p>For a space Letitia stood motionless as a
statue, a tall and splendid figure in her gleaming
dress, on which fine lines of interwoven
silver-work caught and lost the light. Then,
rousing herself, she moved about heavily but
methodically, putting out the remaining lights.
When they were all extinguished she crossed
the hall and slowly ascended the stairway, the
silken whisperings of her skirts being the only
sound in the sleeping house.</p>

<h2 id="V">V</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE season had worn itself away to June.
The winds were an established fact, and
blew from the ocean down the long clefts of
the streets out into the bay beyond. Outside the
Golden Gate the fog lay along the horizon like the
faint gray shores of a distant country. When the
winds dropped at sundown, it came creeping in,
drawing its white cloak over the water, across
the dunes, and finally down the streets and
round the houses. All night it brooded close
over the city, sleeping on its crowded hills, and
in the morning lay brimming in every hollow
till the valleys looked like cups crowned high
with a curdling white drink.</p>

<p>When the sun had driven it back to its cloud-country
on the horizon, there were wonderful
mornings, all blue and gold. The warm rays
licked up the night&rsquo;s moisture, and for a few
clear, still hours had the world to themselves.
They burned the land dry and parched. The
hills at the mouth of the bay turned fawn-color,
and looked like lean, crouching lions with
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>hides that fell away from their gaunt bones.
The sea and sky were a hard-baked blue, with
the little sails of boats and the strenuous green
leafage of tropical plants seeming as if inlaid in
the turquoise background. The gardens about
South Park grew dustier and drier. Only the
aloes appeared to have sap enough to retain
any color, and against the faded monochrome
of the surrounding shrubs they shone a strong,
cold gray-blue. In the Western Addition the
gardens were watered and bloomed extravagantly,
till the ivy geraniums hung from the
window-boxes like pieces of pink carpet, and
the heliotropes dashed themselves in purple
spray to the second stories.</p>

<p>Fashionable people were leaving town daily.
Some were going to the redwoods, where the
forest glades are dim and still and full of a
chill solemnity, like the aisles of old cathedrals.
Others were en route for one of the twin towns
which tip the points of the crescent that holds
Monterey Bay between its horns. Many were
repairing to the country houses which have
sprung up in scattered clusters down the line
of the railroad to the Santa Clara valley. Here
they found the warmth and idleness which Californians
love. All summer the vast expanse
of the valley, shut in from wind and fog by a
rampart of hills, brooded under perpetual sunshine.
In the motionless noons its yellow fields,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>where the shadows of the live-oaks lie round
and black, swam in quivering veils of heat, and
the smell of the tar-weed rose heavy and aromatic,
like the incense from a hundred altars.</p>

<p>The Mortimer Gaults, being fashionable folk,
had broken up their household and gone their
several ways&mdash;Letitia first, with many trunks,
to make visits at hotels and country houses.
Mrs. Gault, like other San Francisco matrons,
did not close her house, but made quick flights
into the country, which she sincerely hated, and
then came back thankfully to town, where she
dwelt in comfort with two servants, and, when
her husband was not with her, ate meals of
choice daintiness, which were laid on a square
of drawn-work on the end of the dining-room
table.</p>

<p>John Gault had not been able to see Letitia
before her departure, which was not so strange,
as she left shortly after the night at the opera.
In the one or two small gatherings which took
place at the Mortimer Gaults&rsquo; before the family
exodus, he had been unable to participate&mdash;at
least, that was what he wrote to Maud. She,
it is needless to state, knowing of that evening
interview after the opera, had tried to elicit
from Letitia an account of what had taken
place. In this, however, she was unsuccessful.
Letitia was at first stubbornly silent, then
cross. But she accepted an invitation to stay
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>with the McCormicks at their country place,
the Hacienda del Pinos, in the Napa valley;
and Maud felt that her extraordinary and inexplicable
sister was, for once in her life, behaving
like a rational human being.</p>

<p>Gault&rsquo;s reluctance to see Letitia had been the
whim of a nature harassed past bearing. He
had gone from her that evening in frenzy with
her, himself, and a world where life was so unlivable
and being alive so remorseless a tragedy.
The man who had never had a serious check in
his easy course from birth to middle age had
now suddenly found himself the central figure
in one of those maddening dilemmas which
blight or make the lives of less fortunate individuals.</p>

<p>The time had come when the situation called
for a determined step. But what step he could
not decide. What particular course of action
would end the whole matter most satisfactorily
for himself was the question that besieged him.
He hardly gave a thought to Viola. He was the
victim of either a repulsively sordid plot, or
else he was a man cruelly lured by fate into a
position from which it seemed impossible to
extricate himself without misery of one sort or
another. At one moment he saw himself as
the gullible victim of a clever pair of adventurers,
and laughed fiercely at the scruples
which prevented him from holding them at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>their own valuation. At the next he was
sickened at the manner in which he was degrading
himself and her by giving way to the
meanest and most dastardly suspicions.</p>

<p>He longed to think that he wronged her, and
yet, so fearful was he of being hoodwinked, so
inclined to distrust himself and the rest of the
world, that he could not rise up and believe in
her, though his love bade him. Once he thought
of going to Tod and asking him to explain his
conversation with Letitia, and then revolted at
the idea of exposing Viola and his own weakness
to the vulgar curiosity of the shallow-brained
youth. The only possible ground for
believing in Viola&rsquo;s innocence was that her
father was deceiving her, and it seemed to
Gault that the old man had neither the subtlety
nor the desire to deceive anybody.</p>

<p>After suffering these torments for some days
he suddenly came to a decision. He resolved
that he would have an interview with Viola,
in which, if she did not voluntarily tell him
the truth, he would demand it from her. He
would at first try to beguile her into an explanation,
and if she evaded this, he would, directly
and without circumlocution, force her to
tell him. He knew it was brutal, but he was
past consideration for any one. He had thought
of this before, but merely from the comfortable
distance of casual speculation. His attitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>now was one of determination. His self-indulgent,
indolent nature had been goaded to a
point where it could act more easily than it
could endure.</p>

<p>Once having made up his mind, he was more
at rest than he had been for weeks. He did
not give much thought to the manner of attacking
the subject, merely saying to himself
that he was sure she could be induced to reveal
all she knew by diplomacy. Of only one thing
he felt convinced, and he felt this with the
conviction that one has of the mandates of
destiny&mdash;that the next time he saw her alone
he would learn from her all there was to learn.
Beyond this he shrank from looking.</p>

<p>While he had no desire to put off the interview
that two months before would have
seemed an impossibility, he was deliberative
and unhurried. Thinking that the afternoon
was the best time to find her by herself, he
went to the house near South Park at four
o&rsquo;clock, a week after he had seen her at the
opera. She was out, and on a second visit at
a similar hour the result was the same. He
had pushed his card under the door, and had
hoped that she might have acknowledged the
visits by a note; but she made no sign.</p>

<p>At the end of the second week he went again,
in the evening, and found her, as usual, sitting
with her father. She mentioned her disa<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>ppointment
at missing him, and said that the
afternoon was a bad time to find her, as she
was almost always either busy or out. This
seemed to him to plainly indicate that she did
not wish to encourage his afternoon visits.
He began to wonder if she was endeavoring to
avoid seeing him alone. If she was, she must
have had some inkling of what he contemplated.
The thought spurred him to a feverish
determination to have the explanation with
her at the earliest opportunity. Heretofore
she had appeared to him a factor which, if he
chose to be hard enough, he could always
manage. Now, if she were to oppose him
with strategy and evasion, the difficulties of
solving the problem would be increased a hundredfold.</p>

<p>But if Viola seemed desirous of escaping a
tÃªte-Ã -tÃªte, the colonel was more assiduous
than ever in seeking the society and bounty
of his obliging friend. The sum to which he
now stood indebted to Gault he described
as being &ldquo;quite formidable.&rdquo; He constantly
spoke of repaying it, and made many vague
allusions to promising enterprises that were
destined to enrich his old age.</p>

<p>Two days after the evening visit the colonel
appeared as usual, and this time produced a
sheet of paper upon which was written a statement
of his indebtedness. It was copied out
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>in his clear, fine hand, each sum scrupulously
set down with its corresponding date, and at
the end of the column of figures the total&mdash;$510.
Slapping his breast-pocket, he remarked
that a duplicate of the memorandum
lay there for his benefit and the stimulating of
his memory.</p>

<p>&ldquo;And when the days of the lean kine are
over,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we will wipe it all out&mdash;clean
the slate.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His friend disclaimed any eagerness as to
the arrival of these golden days, accommodated
the colonel with his customary sum, and
saw the old man go striding out in lofty satisfaction.
Left by himself, he idly looked over
the colonel&rsquo;s memorandum. It was a full
statement, the dates preceding each sum, and
at the top bearing the legend, &ldquo;Memorandum
of moneys loaned by John Gault to Ramsay
Reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He threw the paper into a drawer of his desk
and thought no more about it, though he could
not forbear smiling at the old man&rsquo;s studied
preciseness.</p>

<p>After considerable reflection, Gault decided
that the best way to bring matters to the crisis
he desired was to ask Viola to accord him an
interview. He would manage to make the request
at some moment when the old man was
either not listening&mdash;which was unusual&mdash;or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>had preceded him into the hall in the moment
of departure. If Viola refused, as he had
some reason to think she might, he would
have to arrange another plan, but, for the present,
this was the most feasible one he could
think of.</p>

<p>It was late for a cross-town visit when he
started from his club. The evening, too, was
one of the most disagreeable of the season.
The city lay soaked under a blanket of fog.
On the West Side there was so much life and
activity on the streets, so much light and sound
and pressure of shifting humanity, that, to a
certain extent, the dreariness of the weather
was overcome; but in the dark desolation of
the old quarter the chill weight of the fog lay
like a veil of mystery over the silent streets.</p>

<p>Gault passed down narrow alleys where
his own footsteps were the only sound, and
where the light of the rare lamps seemed
smothered by the dense atmosphere. On the
broad thoroughfare the old mansions looked
like vast, dim ghosts of a lordly past, rising
vague and mournful from huddled masses of
wet foliage. Underfoot the hollows in the
worn asphaltum gleamed with water, and
lengths of brick wall, touched by the beam of
an adjacent lamp, shone as though rain were
falling.</p>

<p>Turning out of this wider way into the cross-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>streets,
he could hear in the silence the fog
dripping off angles in slowly detaching drops.
The old wooden pavements oozed water beneath
the pressure of his foot. Sometimes
from a crack in a sagging shutter an inquisitive
yellow ray shot into the recesses of a
tangled garden, gilding the shining leaves of
great thirsty plants that drank in the reluctantly
distilled moisture. Now and then a
hurrying figure passed him with collar up and
hat drawn down, but for the most part the
streets were deserted, and even at this comparatively
early hour the dwellers in the district
seemed to be retiring, as most of the
houses showed lights only in the upper stories.</p>

<p>In the Reeds&rsquo; house there were the usual
edges of light shining through the cracks and
slits of the old blinds. In answer to his ring
there was the usual moving of this light into
the hall, where it shone out suddenly through
the two narrow panes of glass that flanked the
door. When the door opened there was the
usual picture of Viola shading the light with
one hand, that shone rosily, and looking questioningly
out.</p>

<p>She seemed gladly surprised to see him,
but the old days of her embarrassment were
over. She helped him hang his coat, which
was beaded with moisture, over the back of a
chair, and then paused to arrange the wick of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>her lamp as he preceded her into the drawing-room.
In the doorway he stopped and looked
questioningly about. The colonel was not there.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where is your father?&rdquo; he said, as she
followed him, carrying her lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father?&rdquo; She set the lamp on the
table, still occupied with the recalcitrant wick.
&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s out. He hardly ever goes out in
the evening, but to-night he wanted to see Mr.
Maroney, who is only here from New York for
a few days. Such a dreadful night, too!
There&mdash;I don&rsquo;t think it will smoke any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault, who had absently taken the colonel&rsquo;s
chair, made no response. So the opportunity
he had been planning for had come! He felt
a sensation of sickening repulsion at the task
he had set himself. Already his heart seemed
to have begun to beat like a hammer and his
mouth felt dry. Without consciousness of
what he looked at, his eyes moved about the
room and rested on a black coat which was
hanging over the back of a chair. On the edge
of the table were a pair of scissors, a thimble,
and some spools of thread.</p>

<p>Viola took the vacant chair near these and
put on the thimble.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&rsquo;ll not mind if I go on sewing?&rdquo; she
said. &ldquo;I never thought of your coming to-night,
and so I was fixing this. It will only
take a few moments to finish it.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; Gault asked, in order to say
something, noticing that the garment seemed
heavy and difficult for her to handle.</p>

<p>&ldquo;My father&rsquo;s coat&mdash;the one he wears every
day,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;I was mending it while
he had his other one on. He gets fond of
clothes, and it&rsquo;s next to impossible to get them
away from him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned the coat about every now and
then, her needle assaulting it, and catching
splinters of light as it darted in and out. Gault
leaned back, watching her. She bent her face
over the work as she sewed, presenting to his
gaze the fine white parting down the middle
of her head, and the close-growing threads of
her hair, here and there transmuted into filaments
of gold. There was an air of serenity,
of quietness and peace, about her, that seemed
to tell of an inner sense of happiness.</p>

<p>As he sat back staring at her, and wondering,
with that breathless beating of his heart growing
stronger, what he should say, she suddenly
raised her head and, looking straight into his
eyes, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you thinking about?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her face, with the lamplight shining full on
it, seemed to radiate a soft, pervasive content.
She asked the question with the indescribable
charm of glance and smile of the woman who
knows that her lightest word gives pleasure.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>The increase in her beauty and attraction
which he had felt rose from the consciousness
that she was loved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I wasn&rsquo;t thinking about anything much,&rdquo;
he said evasively. &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to sit on here
this way, not thinking or worrying or caring,
but just watching you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There is no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t do
it; only it doesn&rsquo;t sound very amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t amusing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know it isn&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said contritely, &ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m so sorry that I have to do this old coat;
but it will be done soon, and then we can talk.
Just a minute&mdash;just a minute!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke in a busy tone, and went on turning
the coat about, jerking at the buttons, and
plunging her hands into the pockets.</p>

<p>Gault felt that the pleasure of thus sitting
and looking at her was sapping his resolution.
He felt himself drifting away, aimless and irresponsible,
on the current of the moment. The
duties of past and future were lost sight of
in the dreamy satisfaction of watching the
light on her hair and the movements of her
hands.</p>

<p>He rose suddenly and walked to the window,
with a remark about seeing if the fog was lifting.
As he turned, he saw her take a folded
paper from one of the coat-pockets, and, standing
looking out of the window, heard the crisp
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>rustling of the paper as she unfolded it. There
was a moment of perfect silence, and then he
heard again the same light rustling, which
sounded curiously loud and intrusive to his
irritated nerves.</p>

<p>He turned toward her, wondering why she
did not speak. She was sitting with the
opened paper in her hands, her eyes riveted on
it. As he drew near, he saw that the rustling
rose from the fact that her hands were trembling
violently, causing the paper to vibrate.</p>

<p>She heard his approaching step and looked
up. At the sight of her face he stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she cried, rising suddenly to
her feet and holding it out toward him.</p>

<p>He glanced at it. It was the colonel&rsquo;s duplicate
memorandum. Without aid or provocation
the hour of revelation had come.</p>

<p>His first impulse was to seize it. But she
drew it back from him, repeating in a high,
strained voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it? I don&rsquo;t understand. What
is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing&mdash;nothing but a business
paper. Give it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He did not know what to say or do&mdash;the
scene had changed so suddenly and horribly.
Her face looked at him, pale, bewildered, quivering
with a terrified surmise. Without a moment&rsquo;s
memory of what he had come for, he felt
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>as if all he wanted was to get the paper and
hide it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Give it to me!&rdquo; he demanded authoritatively.
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t concern you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It does,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;it does! But what
is it? What does it mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked back at it, and her eyes ran down
the list of figures, and then were raised to his,
full of a piercingly anguished inquiry.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s nothing but a business matter between
your father and me; and you don&rsquo;t understand
business.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I do understand&mdash;I understand this!&rdquo; she
answered; and then, with a sudden cry of shame
and pain, she threw the crumpled paper on
the table and covered her face with her hands.
&ldquo;Oh, how could he!&rdquo; she whispered. &ldquo;How
could he!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault looked at her, mute and motionless.
From the moment he had seen her face as she
read the paper, he knew that every suspicion
he had had was groundless. He was ashamed
to speak, almost to move. The sound of his
own voice was hateful to him. He stood helplessly
looking at her, shaken with pity, passion,
and remorse. Finally he said gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at me, Viola.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She obeyed him like a child. Her face was
drawn; her eyes, after the moment of meeting
his, sank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Any man would have done what the colonel
did. It&rsquo;s nothing of the least importance.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps not to you,&rdquo; she answered in a
hardly audible voice; &ldquo;but to me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked away and tried to speak lightly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It is of no importance whatever to me, and
I don&rsquo;t see why it should be of any to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Gault, what do you think I am,
that you should say that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A foolish girl who takes a trifling matter
too seriously,&rdquo; he answered quickly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;a woman who has been hurt and
humiliated. It may have been of no importance
to you that you were giving us the clothes
we wore and the food we ate&mdash;but oh! to
me&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice broke, and she turned her face
away.</p>

<p>He made an impatient movement with his
head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Come, don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk about that anymore.
You&rsquo;re not yourself. Besides, whatever insignificant
matter you&rsquo;re worrying about was
not of your doing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, turning on him passionately,
&ldquo;but the responsibility rests on me; for whatever
my father may have done that was wrong
or foolish was for me. There is an excuse
for him. You&mdash;other people&mdash;outsiders&mdash;don&rsquo;t
know. He hasn&rsquo;t wanted these things for him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span>self.
It was all done for me. I was his idol,
and it has almost broken his heart that his
money and position were gone before I was old
enough to profit by them. He always wanted
to be rich again, but it was for me. He wanted
me to have everything&mdash;pretty clothes to wear,
and good things to eat, and theaters and amusements,
like other girls. He tried to keep up
with his old bonanza friends who were tired of
him and had no use for him, because he thought
their wives might be kind to me and ask me to
their houses. He has forgotten himself and
what he owed to me, but it was because he
loved me so much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Viola dear,&rdquo; he said pleadingly, &ldquo;I understand
all this. No one blames the colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not seem to hear him. Her mood
was past control.</p>

<p>&ldquo;When we first met you things were at their
worst. We were in terrible need. We had had
some money&mdash;quite a good deal&mdash;three years
before; it was for a mortgage on the house, or
something; but it had all gone, mostly in Pine
Street. Yours must have gone there, too.
Everything he has had of late years goes
there, because he is determined to make a
second fortune for me before he dies. And he
never will&mdash;poor old man! he never will. I
did what I could and made a little, but he
couldn&rsquo;t bear it, because he hated to think I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span>worked at anything. So that was why he
went to you. We were in despair when we
knew you first&mdash;we were starving.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear child, why go over all this? It&rsquo;s only
a pain to us both.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to take her hands, but she drew
them back and made a gesture as though pushing
him away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t know where it came from. I believed
him. Oh, Mr. Gault, if he told me what
was not true, you can&rsquo;t blame him. You&rsquo;ve
never known what it feels like to have some
one you love wanting the necessaries of life.
You could beg for them&mdash;steal for them! And
when I told you those things about the mining
stock, what did you think I meant? What did
you believe?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She spoke less to him than to her own dazed
and miserable consciousness, which moment
by moment saw new matter for humiliation
in the deception of which she had been the
victim.</p>

<p>But Gault, with the guilt of his own hateful
suspicions weighing upon him, feared that she
had realized his previous state of mistrust, and
said fervently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I did believe what was a wrong to you,
forgive me, Viola. I was a blind fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her head like a stag and transfixed
him with a sudden glance. Unprepared for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>innocence of her point of view, he met the look
shamefacedly, and in an instant she guessed
what he had suspected. In one terrible moment,
illuminated with a blasting flash of
memory, she understood his attitude in the
past, and heard again the words that had
puzzled and surprised her. Horror and despair
seemed to choke her. She drew away
from him, her eyes full of tragic accusation,
murmuring almost under her breath:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You&mdash;that I believed in, and trusted, and
loved!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was a fool&mdash;a brute! I know it. All I
can say is to ask you to forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t forgive&mdash;or forget. Never&mdash;never!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried again to take her hands, but she
drew back from him with what seemed a fierce
repugnance, and cried wildly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go&mdash;you and my father, what have you
done to me? I can&rsquo;t forgive him, either! How
can I? You&rsquo;ve dragged me down, between
you. You&rsquo;ve destroyed me and broken my
heart.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; he cried desperately, &ldquo;listen to me.
You don&rsquo;t know my side. Listen to me while I
tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing to say. I don&rsquo;t want to
hear. I know enough. Go&mdash;go away from me!
Oh, my father! My poor father! How could
you! How could you!&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span></p>

<p>She burst into tears&mdash;the most terrible tears
that he had ever seen. Throwing herself into
the colonel&rsquo;s chair, she lay huddled there, her
face pressed into the arm, her slender figure
shaken by the explosive force of her grief.</p>

<p>To his broken words and appeals she made
no answer. He doubted whether she heard
him. The storm of feeling, stronger than he
had ever supposed her capable of, swayed her
as a blast sways a sapling. Finally he bent
over her and rested his cheek on her hair,
whispering:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I want to do everything you ask me. But
before I go, say you forgive me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised herself and pushed him away.
Her face was almost unrecognizable, blurred
and swollen with tears.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go&mdash;go!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;That is all I want of
you. You&rsquo;ve done enough harm to me. Do
what I ask now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He attempted to bend over her and say some
last words of farewell, but she turned her face
away from him and pressed it into the upholstered
arm of the chair. He kissed her hair,
and stood for a moment looking at her, then
turned and crossed the room. At the door he
stopped and looked back.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Good-by,&rdquo; he said hesitatingly.</p>

<p>A smothered good-by came from her. He
waited, hoping for some word of forgiveness
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>or recall. Instead, she said once more, this
time pleadingly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, go! please go&mdash;I want to be alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He obeyed her&mdash;softly opened the door into
the hall, put on his coat, and let himself out
into the cold and fog-bedewed night. As he
fumbled with the gate he heard a quick, swinging
step coming from the darkened end of the
street. It approached rapidly, and into the
dense aureole of light shed by a lamp half-way
up the block, a tall, muscular figure emerged
from the surrounding blackness. Gault recognized
the walk and the square, erect shoulders.
With as little noise as possible he opened the
gate, and, turning in the opposite direction,
passed into the darkness with a stealthy tread.</p>

<p>The colonel let himself in with his latch-key,
pulled off his coat in the hall, and entered the
drawing-room with the buoyancy that characterized
all his movements. As was often the
case in these days of prosperity, he carried a
paper bag full of fruit and a box of candy for
Viola.</p>

<p>To his eye, dulled by the darkness without,
the room looked brilliantly illuminated and
seemed to welcome him with the warm and
cheery note of home. Viola was standing with
her back to him, her elbow on the chimney-piece.
When she heard his step on the walk
she had made a violent effort to control herself,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>had tried to rub away the stains of her tears,
and had turned the paper flower on the lamp-globe
so that the light, as it fell upon her, was
subdued.</p>

<p>The colonel was in good spirits. He laid his
packages on the table and began opening them.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Wasn&rsquo;t that Gault that I saw coming away
as I came down the street?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>Viola said &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why didn&rsquo;t you keep him longer? I&rsquo;d
like to have seen him. Look at that pear,&rdquo;
said the old man, holding up a yellow Bartlett
that gleamed like wax in the lamplight. &ldquo;Did
you ever see anything finer than that? And
there are people who say they don&rsquo;t like the
Californian fruit.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola did not look at the pear, but he was
too occupied in his purchases to notice her.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He ought to have stayed till I came in.
You oughtn&rsquo;t to have let him go. Poor old
Gault, coming out in all this wet! It&rsquo;s a
devil of a night. You could cut the fog with
a knife. What did he have to say for himself?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing much,&rdquo; said Viola.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think myself he&rsquo;s much of a talker.
Now, see what I&rsquo;ve brought for you.&rdquo; Viola
heard the tearing away of the wrappers that
were folded around the candy-box. &ldquo;Look,
young woman; isn&rsquo;t that tempting?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span></p>

<p>The colonel held out the box. Viola did not
turn. He drew it back, a puzzled expression
on his face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t
you look at me? Don&rsquo;t you feel well?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She turned round slowly and made a feint to
take the box. As the colonel&rsquo;s glance fell on
her face he gave a sharp exclamation and
started to his feet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s happened?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the
matter with you?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She tried to tell him, but could not. The love
and honor of him that had been the faith of her
life were still alive. She could not say the words
that would bring him to shame. Suddenly she
pointed to the crumpled paper on the table. The
colonel snatched it and pulled it open while she
turned away. He recognized it at the first
glance.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, holding his head high and
looking at her with a defiant air, &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She made no answer, and he went on violently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s there wrong about this to make
you cry as if you&rsquo;d lost everything in the
world, and Gault to sneak out of the house
like a thief?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong about it?&rdquo; she burst out.
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s wrong about you to make you ask
such a question?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;My dear, don&rsquo;t be so violent,&rdquo; said the
colonel, trying to assume his old jaunty manner.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s all a very simple matter, easily explained.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then explain it, father&mdash;explain it. Oh, if
there&rsquo;s anything to be said, say it!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s merely a business matter, a financial
transaction between myself and Gault&mdash;nothing
that concerns you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, father, it concerns me more than anything
that has ever happened to me in my life
before.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her tone wrung the colonel&rsquo;s soul. He tried
to silence his pain and fear by a sudden attempt
to divert the blame from himself.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Did that dog&mdash;that mean, underhanded
sneak&mdash;come here to-night, when he knew I
was out, to show you that paper?&rdquo;</p>

<p>His manner and words horrified her, and she
shrank from him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I found the paper in your coat. He tried
to take it from me. He never breathed to me
or let me suspect what you were doing. To-night,
when I found the paper, he tried to make
me think it was all right, quite an ordinary
thing&mdash;that you had done what every one else
would have done.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, why do you get so worked up
about it? Why should a business transaction
between him and me put you into such a state
of mind?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;A business transaction? Oh, father, have
you deceived yourself, or are you trying to deceive
me? What has been the matter with
you? How could you do it! How could you
forget yourself that way&mdash;yourself and me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel&rsquo;s bravado began to give way, but
he tried to take a last stand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If there was anything wrong, as you seem
to think, in what I did, you shouldn&rsquo;t blame
me for it. I did it for you. I was trying to
make you comfortable and make things a little
easier for you. I was only trying the best way
I knew to make you happy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Make me happy!&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;Did you
think it would make me happy to have a man
think I was being sold to him?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The words burst from her, vibrating with all
the anguish of the last two hours. They struck
the colonel like a dagger in his heart.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Viola!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Viola&mdash;don&rsquo;t!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He began to tremble, and sat down, looking
at her with an aghast, protesting look. Whatever
his idea had been in so openly using
Viola&rsquo;s name in his dealings with Gault, he had
not meant that. Old age, bitter poverty, trampled
pride&mdash;all had combined to lower that
high standard, that proud self-respect, which
his daughter had believed to be his. She would
never believe in them again.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You oughtn&rsquo;t to say that, Viola,&rdquo; he said
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>in a low voice; &ldquo;you oughtn&rsquo;t to say that
to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She did not stir, and he said again, after a
moment&rsquo;s pause:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s not right for you to say that. I
thought I was doing for the best. I may have
done foolishly, but it was because I loved
you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He spoke heavily, sitting inert and sunken,
with the lamplight pouring over his wrinkled
face and white hair.</p>

<p>Suddenly Viola ran toward him. She put
her arms round his neck, close and warm, and
her tears fell on his hair, on his face, on his
coat. She hugged his head against her breast
and kissed it wildly, sobbing over and over:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, my poor father! Oh, my poor father!
Oh, my poor father!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man patted her head and said gently:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t&mdash;don&rsquo;t go on that way. You didn&rsquo;t
say anything. I&rsquo;ve forgotten it already.&rdquo;</p>

<p>But she knew he had not, and continued
sobbing out passionate, broken sentences:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;I spoke without thinking.
Oh, please forget it! Don&rsquo;t look like
that! I didn&rsquo;t mean it&mdash;I didn&rsquo;t mean it for
a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He tried to soothe and comfort her, but he
himself was very quiet. When she had sobbed
herself into a state of apathetic exhaustion, he
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>helped her up-stairs to her room, and prowled
up and down in the passageway, every now
and then listening at her door till he heard her
caught breaths regulate themselves into the
long, regular ones of heavy sleep.</p>

<p>Then he went into his own room. He did
not go to bed, but sat motionless, shrunk together,
staring at the light. His love for his
daughter had been dear to him, but a thousand
times dearer had been his realization of her
love for him. When all the world had turned
its back on him, the knowledge that he was
still believed in, watched for, cherished by this
one young girl had made life as well worth living
as it had been in the days of his glory.
And now he had lost that&mdash;it was gone forever.
He was an old man, and to-night he had
received his death-blow.</p>

<p>The day after his scene with Viola was the
happiest John Gault had known for many
months. The memory of her pain, of her tears,
of her humiliation, could not outweigh the joy
he felt in her exculpation. Even his own
shame at the meanness of the part he had
played was pushed aside by this pervasive,
irradiating, uplifting sense of happiness. No
cloud, no shadow of disbelief, could ever come
between them now. He could love her without
mistrust, without fear, without suspicion.
He would absorb her, envelop her, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span>wrap
her in the might of his passion. He had
wronged her bitterly, but with what limitless
tenderness, what depths of devotion, would he
make up for it! He was troubled by no doubts
as to her feeling for him. The memory of the
light in her eyes as they met his, of the flush on
the cheek, were enough. Viola was his when
he chose to claim her.</p>

<p>Still, the deliberative habits of his curiously
sensitive and conventional nature were stronger
than the force of his last and deepest attachment.
Three days followed his interview with
Viola, and he had not yet gone to see her. He
could not bring himself to intrude upon her.
Her girl&rsquo;s passion of shame and grief seemed
a sanctuary into which no man&rsquo;s coarse eye
should look. He thought of her with a deep,
almost reverential tenderness, but he did not
feel as if he ought to see her till the first
anguish of her discovery had spent itself.
Then&mdash;then&mdash;he would take her in his arms,
and there would be nothing to say, only to ask
her to forgive him, to hear her say it, and
then happiness&mdash;happiness&mdash;happiness&mdash;on to
the end of time.</p>

<p>On the fourth day he decided to send her
some flowers. But after he had bought them
it seemed to him so meaningless, so banal, to
send such a formal offering, one that he had
sent so often to women for whom his senti<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span>ments
were so widely different, that he suddenly
changed his mind, and ordered the
flowers to be sent to his sister-in-law, who was
just then in town. When he walked away
from the florist&rsquo;s he looked rather ashamed of
himself and of his burst of sentiment. But
what did he want to send her flowers for? He
wanted to see her, to take her hands in his and
look down deep into those beautiful gray eyes
and say&mdash;perhaps not say anything. She and
he understood.</p>

<p>He made up his mind that he would go on
the morrow, and on this decision he went to
sleep with a light heart. In the morning he
was awakened by a messenger to say that his
brother Mortimer had returned from the country
seriously ill. He was at the house on Pacific
Avenue inside an hour. Mortimer had come
home a week before with a bad cold which had
developed into a dangerous case of pneumonia.
Maud Gault was helpless and distracted. Her
brother-in-law spent the day in attending to
the numerous duties which crop up with sickness,
and in the evening telegraphed for Letitia.</p>

<p>For the four following days Mortimer Gault
hung between life and death, brooded over by
a frantic wife, three doctors, two nurses, a fond
sister-in-law, and an extremely anxious brother.
The tie between the two men was very close&mdash;John
had never realized how close till those
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>four days of desperate anxiety were over.
During this time, as he sat either by his brother&rsquo;s
bedside or in one of the rooms adjoining, or
made hasty visits to his office, he thought of
Viola and wondered if she was puzzled by his
lengthened absence. He did not think that she
would misunderstand it. Like many men, he
took it for granted that her knowledge of his
character and affairs had been as thorough as
the knowledge his superior insight and experience
had given him into all that pertained
to her.</p>

<p>On the sixth day after his brother&rsquo;s summons
Mortimer was pronounced out of danger.
This was the first opportunity John had had of
seeing Viola.</p>

<p>At four o&rsquo;clock he alighted from the car that
had carried him across town to the old quarter
about South Park. As he passed through the
dingy side streets holiday reigned in his heart.
Life in the past seemed dun and dreary compared
to what it had become under the influence
of the still, almost rapt joy which now
possessed him. An immense, deep tenderness
seemed to well from his heart over all his being.
His love for Viola seemed to have made him
see and feel all that was love-worthy in others&mdash;in
the children that ran across his path or played
in chattering groups in the gutters, the women
he met trudging home with baskets on their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>arms, the lean-shanked boys playing ball in the
deserted gardens, the tousled young matrons
exchanging gossip from open upper windows.
He had never noticed these people before, save
with cold repugnance; now he seemed to be
able to see into them and note their justifiable
ambitions, their unselfish struggles, their
smiling, patient courage. The thought passed
through his mind that perhaps this exalted, unusual
affection was the love of the future state,
the happiness that awaits the liberated soul.</p>

<p>He turned the last corner and came in sight
of the house. For the first few advancing steps
he did not realize what gave it an unfamiliar
look. Then, as he approached, he saw that the
vines which had hung in bunches about the
bay-window were cut away. There were frilled
white curtains in the lower windows. He drew
near, staring astonished through his glasses,
each step revealing some innovation.</p>

<p>They were evidently renovating the whole
place. The two thick-set brick posts that supported
the gate had been painted. The steps
to the porch had been mended with new wood.
Then, as he put his hand forward to unlatch the
gate, he saw a woman&mdash;a broad-backed, red-necked
woman in a blue print dress&mdash;kneeling
on the ground just below the bay-window, evidently
gardening. The sight surprised him into
immobility, and for a moment he stood motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>less,
gazing at the back of her head, where her
hair was twisted into a tight and uncompromising
coil about as big as a silver dollar.</p>

<p>The next moment he pressed the latch, and
the gate opened with a click. The woman
started and turned round. Evidently greatly
surprised at the figure her glance encountered,
she straightened herself from her stooping posture,
eying him curiously and wiping her
earthy hands on her apron.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is Miss Reed in?&rdquo; he said, advancing up
the flagged walk.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Miss Reed?&rdquo; said the woman &ldquo;No. She
ain&rsquo;t here any more.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault stopped.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Colonel
Reed lives here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Not now,&rdquo; said the woman, struggling to
her feet. &ldquo;He did until last week. We bought
the place off of him just seven days ago, and
moved in Tuesday.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that he has sold it and gone
away?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s it. We rushed it through, both of
us. He wanted to sell &rsquo;bout as much as we
wanted to buy, so there wasn&rsquo;t much time
wasted on either side.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Had he thought of selling it for any length
of time?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t rightly say as to that. We&rsquo;ve had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>our eyes on it for the past five years. My husband&mdash;he&rsquo;s
Robson, the dry-goods dealer, on
Third, just below here&mdash;was pretty well satisfied
that the colonel couldn&rsquo;t hang on to it forever.
&rsquo;Bout three years ago he offered him
three thousand. But the old man wouldn&rsquo;t
hear of it. Said he wouldn&rsquo;t even raise a mortgage
on it, as it was all he had to leave to his
daughter when he died. But we knew he
couldn&rsquo;t hold out much longer. He didn&rsquo;t have
no work, nor nothing to live on. Miss Reed
she made a little, but not enough to run
everything, and&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;I know all about that. When did
you say they left?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;On Monday, and we moved in Tuesday.
Saturday the old man came round to Mr. Robson&rsquo;s
place and said he&rsquo;d let him have the house
for anything he chose to give. There ain&rsquo;t
nothing mean about Mr. Robson. He could &rsquo;a&rsquo;
beat the colonel down to &rsquo;most anything, but he
said he&rsquo;d give him two thousand cash down,
and the old man just jumped at it. Mr. Robson
said it would &rsquo;a&rsquo; been business to get the colonel
to a lower figure, and he said he supposed he
would &rsquo;a&rsquo; done it if it hadn&rsquo;t been for the daughter.
She was sick, and the old man said he&rsquo;d
got to have money to take her away.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Sick?&mdash;seriously sick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, as to that I can&rsquo;t say. But she was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>about the peakedest-looking girl I ever seen.
I was awful sorry for them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where have they gone?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t able to say.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But you surely have some idea of where
they&rsquo;ve moved to? Didn&rsquo;t they say something
about their intentions? Didn&rsquo;t the colonel
tell your husband in reference to the transfer
of the money?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;They didn&rsquo;t neither of &rsquo;em say a word.
They&rsquo;re the most close-mouthed pair I ever
ran into. My husband paid the money down
in cash the day we moved in. They took it, and
that&rsquo;s all I know about them.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Can&rsquo;t you tell me some one about here who
may know more&mdash;some of the tradespeople&mdash;butchers,
grocers, that sort of thing?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;You might try Coggles, the grocer at the
corner. I think they had an account with him.
But they didn&rsquo;t deal regular with any one
else.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault thanked her and turned to go. She
followed him down the walk, anxious to be
agreeable, for his manner and appearance had
impressed her immensely.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If I hear anything about them I&rsquo;ll let you
know,&rdquo; she said affably.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Thanks; it&rsquo;s very good of you,&rdquo; he answered,
opening the gate. But he had no intention of
giving her either his name or address, as he did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>not for a moment think that this disappearance
of the Reeds was other than temporary.</p>

<p>At the corner he stopped and inquired for
them at Coggles the grocer&rsquo;s. Coggles himself
answered his inquiries. He had even less information
to give than Mrs. Robson. A week
before the colonel had paid such small amounts
as he yet owed, and had casually mentioned
the fact that he had sold his house and was
about to leave the city. This was all Coggles
knew. He showed some desire to talk over the
colonel&rsquo;s pecuniary difficulties, but Gault cut
him short and left the store.</p>

<p>Gault walked away, feeling dazed and hardly
master of himself. It had been so absolutely
unexpected that he did not yet send his mind
back over their past intercourse to ask what
she might have been thinking since he saw her
last. As is the case of the man in love, he had
seen the situation only from his own side. But
he did not for a moment doubt that he would
hear from her within the next few days.</p>

<p>He was still with his brother a good deal of
the time, and the days that followed passed
with the swiftness which characterizes hours
filled with various anxieties. Four days after
learning of her flight, two weeks from the evening
that he had seen her last, the janitor at his
office handed him a small but heavy package.
It had been left early in the morning by a boy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>the janitor said, who had merely asked if this
was Mr. John Gault&rsquo;s office, and had then
hastened away.</p>

<p>An instinct told him it was from her, and he
shut himself into his inner office before he
opened it. It was a rough wooden box, and
contained the money given by him to the
colonel&mdash;five hundred and ten dollars in gold
coin. Lying on the top was a slip of paper
bearing the words: &ldquo;Good-by. <span class="smcap">Viola</span>.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Still he could not but believe that she would
soon reveal her whereabouts. The move was
occupying her, and such an operation would
seem a gigantic undertaking to her youthful
inexperience. That she should treat him this
way was thoughtless, cruel even, but she had
been deeply wounded, and her hurt was evidently
still sore. He could only wait patiently.</p>

<p>He did so for two weeks, his uncertainties
growing into fears, his conviction of her intention
to communicate with him gradually weakening.
Uneasiness gave place to alarm. For
the first time the haunting thought that she had
gone from him purposely, fled forever from his
love, entered his mind.</p>

<p>Finally, unable to endure the anxiety that
now beset him, he commissioned a private detective
agency to run to earth the boy who had
brought the money. He supposed it had come
directly from her, and that, through the boy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span>without drawing her into the affair, her hiding-place
could be discovered.</p>

<p>The finding of the boy was not so simple a
matter as might have been supposed. It required
a week&rsquo;s search to locate him. He was
the only son of a poor widow living near South
Park, who had done the Reeds&rsquo; washing. Before
her departure Miss Reed had commissioned
him to deliver the package at Mr.
Gault&rsquo;s office at a certain date, and at an hour
when there would be no chance of his coming
into personal contact with Mr. Gault himself.</p>

<p>Gault snatched at this meager information,
and lost no time in seeking out the widow in
her own home. She was a good-natured and
loquacious Irish-American,&mdash;Mrs. Cassidy by
name,&mdash;and was full of terror at the thought
that detectives had been occupied in discovering
her place of abode. Her fears, however,
were soon allayed, and she became exceedingly
discursive. But when it came to information
of Viola, she could tell no more than the others.</p>

<p>Before Miss Reed had left the city she had
given the package to the boy, with the instructions
that he should not deliver it till the day
set by her, some time after her departure. Of
her own volition Mrs. Cassidy stated that she
thought Miss Reed did not want any one to
know where she went. Mrs. Cassidy had conferred
with others of her kind in the locality,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>and the silent and hasty departure of the
Reeds had been matter of comment. The
shrewd Irishwoman saw that there was a mysterious
romance here, and her glance dwelt
with compassionate curiosity upon the gentleman
who was sufficiently interested in the
pretty girl they had all known by sight to employ
detectives to hunt for her.</p>

<p>The finding of the boy and the interview
with Mrs. Cassidy broke down the last of Gault&rsquo;s
hopes. He now knew that Viola had intentionally
fled from him. At first, when no word
came from her, and Mrs. Robson&rsquo;s description
of her as ill was fresh in his mind, he had a
terrible fear that she might have died. But a
later judgment convinced him that had this
been the case he would have heard from the
colonel. Viola was living&mdash;hiding somewhere
from him, restraining her father from communicating
with him, which, Gault knew, would
be the old man&rsquo;s wish and intention.</p>

<p>And now, with the blankness of her absence
deadening his heart, for the first time
he began to understand what she must have
thought and felt&mdash;began to see the situation
with her eyes. He thought of her, loving
and believing in him as he knew she had
always done, suddenly waking to the knowledge
that he had suspected her. He saw her
living over again those conversations in which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>he had half revealed his groundless doubts,
had tried to find confirmation of them in the
halting admissions of her puzzled ignorance.
And with her comprehension of the light in
which he had been regarding her came that
<i>coup de grÃ¢ce</i> of all doubts in his favor&mdash;the
giving of the money.</p>

<p>With a clearness of vision that was like
clairvoyance, he seemed to be able to read down
into the depths of her consciousness, to see
into the hidden places of the nature he had
once thought so jealously secretive. In the
gnawing bitterness of his remorse he realized
that she had believed herself tricked, that the
hand she had thought stretched to her in
kindly fellowship in reality concealed a trap.
Where she had looked for protection, support,
and love, she had found what now presented
itself to her as a sinister and cruel craftiness.
Her best friend had turned out to be her most
unrelenting enemy.</p>

<p>In the loneliness of that long summer he
came face to face with despair. He had lost
her by his own mad folly. Remorse for the
wrong he had done her alternated in his
thoughts with an unquenchable longing to see
her again. His heart craved for her, even if only
for a single moment&rsquo;s glimpse. A younger
man would have shaken off the gloom of his
first great disappointment, have told himself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>that there were other eyes as sweet and hearts
as true. But with him the elasticity of youth
was gone. There was no forming of new ties,
no delight in fresh faces. Life had offered him
supreme happiness, and he had let it pass by
him. Like the base Indian, he had &ldquo;thrown a
pearl away richer than all his tribe.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The summer held the city in its spell of wind
and fog. Acquaintances who encountered one
another on its wide thoroughfares said town
was empty&mdash;not a soul left in it. The Mortimer
Gaults took themselves away for rest and recuperation
to balsamic mountain gorges among
the redwoods. Letitia returned to the hotels
and the Hacienda del Pinos. John Gault was
left alone with his empty heart. If she had
died it would have been bearable. The inevitableness
of death makes us bow to its blows with
broken submission. But she was alive&mdash;poor,
sick, her love disprized, her pride trampled on,
driven away from all that was familiar and
friendly to her by fear of him.</p>

<p>The winds beat and tore through the city, buffeting
the passers-by and sweeping street and
alley. Then, as the color deepened toward evening,
their stress and clamor suddenly ceased, a
burst of radiance ran from the Golden Gate up
the sky, glazing the level floor of the bay and
flaring on all the western windows. It stayed
for a space, seeming to immerse the town in an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>atmosphere of beaten gold, as if for one brief
half-hour it was transformed into the glistening
El Dorado of the early settlers&rsquo; dreams. Then
the fog stole noiselessly in, and the houses
crowding to the summits of the hills, the rose-red
clouds, and the clear purple distances were
blotted out.</p>

<p>That went on day by day till the autumn
came. The winds dropped and the sun shone
all day. In the country the air was clear and
heavy with sweet, aromatic scents. All the
fields were parched and sun-dried like hemp;
only the thick-growing, bushy trees defied the
drought, remaining green and hardy. The great
hills were scorched to a smooth yellow, with a
few green tree-tufts slipped down into their
valleys where the watercourses were not quite
dry.</p>

<p>In town it was all still and golden and hot.
The city, queening it on its hills, rose in an
atmosphere of crystal clearness from a girdle
of sapphire sea. In the evening the smoke lay
lightly over it, and the sun glared through like
a great, inquisitive eye. Poor people in the
old districts were ill from lack of rain and from
unclean sewers. Rich people were coming back,
looking sunburnt and healthy from their summer
in the open air.</p>

<p>The Gaults came up out of their lounging-place
in the redwoods, robust and blooming,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[Pg 181]</a></span>Mortimer quite restored to health, and Maud
two shades darker with her country tan. Letitia,
with three trunks of ruined millinery, appeared
from the hotels, and the town house was
once more alive.</p>

<p>They had seen little of John since they left
for the country, and it was not strange that
Maud Gault, after his first visit, should have
said to her husband:</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter with John? All of a
sudden he looks quite old.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said the loyal Mortimer; &ldquo;only a
fellow can&rsquo;t be expected to look young forever.
John&rsquo;s not like a woman: he doesn&rsquo;t keep the
same age for twenty years.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="VI">VI</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HE selling of the house and the subsequent
flight of the Reeds had been, as Gault
had guessed, Viola&rsquo;s idea. When, the morning
after those two soul-destroying interviews, she
had come down, white and apathetic, and had
told her father that she wanted to leave the
city, the old man, in a desperate desire to reinstate
himself in her regard, had been willing to
accede to anything.</p>

<p>Pressed by Viola, he had hurried through the
sale, had taken the small sum Robson had
offered without demur, and, driven by her feverish
anxiety, had paid off all their household
debts and handed to her the remaining money.
This, with himself, he had placed entirely in
her hands. As the girl locked it into the small
tin box in which she kept such valuables as
they possessed, she had suddenly looked at it,
and then at him, and finally said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But the mortgage? Wasn&rsquo;t there interest
or something to pay on that?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mortgage!&rdquo; said the colonel, in innocent
surprise. &ldquo;What mortgage?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span></p>

<p>Viola looked away from him and murmured
something about being mixed up. She saw
that he had forgotten the story by which, three
years ago, he had accounted to her for the first
sudden era of prosperity. She felt, with a
dreary indifference, that she did not care where
that money had come from. She, at least, had
not been put forward as a means of procuring it.</p>

<p>The breathless hurry of their departure, and
the quantity of work that accumulates about the
breaking up of even so small a household, gave
her no time for the indulgence of her own bitter
thoughts. The days passed in a turmoil of
noise and movement. In a nightmare atmosphere
of dust and strange faces she haggled
with the Jews from the second-hand stores on
Mission Street, listened to their sarcastic comments
on the old pieces of furniture she had
passed her life among, watched them with dull
eyes as they tested the springs of the colonel&rsquo;s
chair and rubbed between appraising fingers
the curtains his young bride had bought
twenty-four years before. At night she crept
into her bed, too exhausted for thought, to lose
herself in blessed gulfs of sleep.</p>

<p>She was possessed by a wild desire to escape
from the house and the city. The scene of her
humiliation had become intolerable to her, and
deep in her heart lay the terror that if she remained
it would be the scene of her downfall.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>The thought of Gault&rsquo;s reappearance filled her
with dread. She was confident of his return,
and his return as the conqueror who had
gauged her weakness and his own power. All
her trust in him had been shattered at a blow.
Suddenly he had appeared to her, not as the
lover whose highest wish was for her happiness,
but as the master, cruel and relentless,
the owner who had bought and paid for her.
The shame of the thought that she still loved
him caused her to bow her face upon her breast,
hiding it from the eyes of men and the light of
day. All she could whisper in her own justification
was the words, &ldquo;But when I grew to
love him I never knew&mdash;I never guessed for a
minute what he meant.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She wanted to begin all over again, to be another
person in another place. The charm of
home had vanished from the little house. She
longed to put it behind her, to be a different
woman from the Viola Reed who once within
its narrow walls had known the taste of happiness.</p>

<p>She was so engrossed in her own sorrows
that she thought nothing of her father, heretofore
the first consideration of her life. She
told him what he should do, and he did it unquestioningly.
Though no more angry words
had passed between them, it seemed to the
frightened old man as if every day she receded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span>further from him. His only thought was to
repair the damage he had done, to climb back
somehow into his old position. He tried to
anticipate her every wish, and followed her
about with humble offers of help. But when,
during those days of work and hurry, her eyes
met his, they seemed to him to have a hard and
alien gleam. It struck upon his somewhat
vague contrition like an icy wind. If she had
been gay and talkative he would have forgotten
the wrong he had done her in twenty-four
hours, and been ready to laugh with her at
Gault. But she seemed now to have suddenly
ranged herself against him on Gault&rsquo;s side, and
to have left him, chilled and solitary, out in
the cold.</p>

<p>So when she told him they would go to Sacramento,
though the thought of change turned
his heart to lead, he agreed with a good grace.
He also acquiesced in all her injunctions about
keeping their place of refuge a secret. When
she told him of her plan to return Gault&rsquo;s
money, he controlled his desire to disagree
with it, and accepted her decision without open
murmur. It seemed to him an unnecessary
waste. What were the few paltry hundreds to
the rich man? The colonel had been rich, too,
and had aided hundreds of needy ones without
ever thinking of repayment. By some obscure
mental processes he had come to believe that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>Gault wanted the money. Now that the
younger man had come between him and Viola,
his feeling for him had become sharply hostile.
It was only fear of reopening a disagreeable
subject that prevented him from abusing his
former friend to his daughter.</p>

<p>They left the city with very different feelings.
To the colonel his departure was as the
dragging out of every fiber. The roots of his life
seemed to have struck deep down into that
sandy soil. His horizon had always been
bounded by the long lines of gray houses, by
the girdling blue of the bay. To the girl it
seemed a flight from shame and misery. She
was not escaping from it: part of it would go
with her always; but she was putting behind
her her own weakness and the temptation and
despair that the weakness of others had brought
upon her.</p>

<p>As the train carried them farther away, as
the bay faded out of sight, and the scarred and
dwarf scrub-oaks gave place to the stately trees
of the valleys, she felt her breath come with
the sigh of a deep relief, and to her blank heart
whispered the consolation, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s over and
done. I shall never see him again.&rdquo;</p>

<p>At Sacramento they found shelter in a cheap
boarding-house. It was a large old house on a
side street, set back from the publicity of the
thoroughfare in an extensive garden. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>garden was so far cared for that it was watered,
and the palms and aloes and fig-trees had
reached a mighty growth; but its paths were
weed-grown, and the statues and urns raised
by its original owners lay overturned in the
rank grass.</p>

<p>The house itself, dropping fast into peeling,
unpainted decay, was commodious, with the
high, airy rooms that were built in the days
when all Californians seemed to be prosperous,
and space was not too valuable to be sacrificed
to comfort. The rooms still showed traces of
their fine beginnings. There were exceedingly
bad and elaborate frescos on the lofty ceilings
of the lower floor, and great mirrors incased in
gold moldings crowned the mantelpieces. In
the musty, unaired parlors, where the puckered
inside shades of faded silk were always down
to keep the sun from revealing the threadbare
secrets of the pale old carpets and the frayed
satin arm-chairs, the colonel felt as if he were
having a nightmare of the old days. It was
all so like in its largeness, its rich stiffness, its
obvious expensiveness, but so terribly unlike in
its stuffy, squalid, unclean penury.</p>

<p>In the evening at dinner they met their fellow-boarders.
The wide dining-room, with
long windows opening on one of the many balconies
that projected from the walls, showed
the same frescos, the same pale, rose-strewn
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>carpet, the same cumbrous pieces of furniture,
that, forty years back, some mining prince
had brought round the Horn in a sailing-ship.
The smell of hundreds of boarding-house dinners
hung in the folds of the dingy lace curtains.
From a crystal chandelier, lacking most
of its pendants, a garish burst of light fell
over the table, where much plated ware and
pressed glass made a glittering array on a dirty
cloth.</p>

<p>At the head of the board sat Mrs. Seymour,
the landlady, and beside her her only child,
Corinne, a sharp-faced little girl of eight, who,
leaning with her elbows on the table, let her
glance, shrewd, penetrating, and amused, pass
from face to face. Mrs. Seymour, a large
woman of a countenance originally buxomly
pleasant, but hardened by contact with the
world as the boarding-house keeper meets it,
introduced the newcomers. They presented a
curious contrast to their fellows. The colonel,
whose social tastes had not fallen with his fortunes,
was a trifle puzzled by the society in
which he found himself. At the same time his
gregarious spirit was cheered to see that there
were other people in the house. He bowed to
the lady on his right, introduced as Miss Mercer,
with elaborate gallantry, and drawing out
her chair, stood waiting for her to seat herself.
The recipient of this unexpected courtesy did
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span>not know how to take it, for the moment suspecting
some joke.</p>

<p>To Viola the strange faces seemed unlovely
and forbidding. She had met few people in
her life, and this sudden plunge into society
was a portentous experience. Pale and silent
under the glare of the chandelier, she nibbled
at her food, having neither heart nor courage
to speak. When she raised her eyes she saw
the young man opposite&mdash;Mrs. Seymour had
presented him as &ldquo;Bart Nelson, our prize young
man&rdquo;&mdash;staring at her over his plate with a
steady, ruminating air. As he met her eyes for
the second time, he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Off your feed?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And then, in reply to the colonel&rsquo;s look of
uneasy inquiry, jerked his head toward Viola
and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Seymour ain&rsquo;t goin&rsquo; to lose anything
by her.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour replied that she wanted somebody
like that to even things off against such
an appetite as Mr. Nelson&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>The laugh then was on the prize young man,
and he joined in it as heartily as the others.</p>

<p>Miss Mercer, who, it appeared, was a school-teacher,
and who had the tight-mouthed visage
and dominant voice of those who habitually instruct
the young, said she guessed Miss Reed
was trying to put Mrs. Seymour off her guard;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>it was a case of making a good impression in
the beginning.</p>

<p>The voice of the little girl here rose with
penetrating suddenness:</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t ever eat much. She&rsquo;s too thin.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola, suddenly the objective point of interest
of the table, felt herself growing red and
embarrassed. That she might hide her face
from this alarming concentration of attention,
she pretended to drop her napkin, and bent
down to get it. The landlady, with a tact that
her appearance belied, saw that the girl was
uncomfortable, and diverted the conversation.</p>

<p>It swelled, and was tossed back and forth
about the table with much laughter and jest of
a personal nature. There were but six people
in the house besides Mrs. Seymour, and these
seemed intimately conversant with one another&rsquo;s
histories and individual foibles. The
school-teacher was attacked about an admirer
known as &ldquo;Little Willie,&rdquo; and after a moment
of confusion she made a spirited return on the
young man beside her, whom every one called
Charley, but who had been presented to Viola
as Mr. Ryan. Charley&rsquo;s infatuation for a lady
who had ridden a bicycle in a recent vaudeville
performance seemed to be a subject of gossip,
and the school-teacher added further poignancy
to the tale by relating how this lady, having
made an appointment to lunch with Charley,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>had failed to keep the tryst. The glee roused
over Charley&rsquo;s discomfiture was loud and deep.
A heavily bearded man who sat at the foot of
the table, and was ceremoniously addressed as
Mr. Betts, lay back in his chair and roared.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Charley!&rdquo; he gasped, when he had recovered
his composure, &ldquo;she got you straight
in the slats that time.&rdquo;</p>

<p>His wife, at the other end of the table, said
with a prim air: &ldquo;What I&rsquo;d like to know is
where Miss Mercer hears all these stories.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Little birds tell them to her,&rdquo; said the child,
in her sudden, piercing voice. &ldquo;I guess they&rsquo;re
trained birds.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After dinner, when they had gone up-stairs,
the colonel stopped with Viola at her door.
The passage was dimly lit by a gas-jet at the
farther end, which was turned economically low.
From the parlor bursts of laughter ascended.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, good night, honey,&rdquo; said the colonel.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry you&rsquo;re so tired.&rdquo; Then, somewhat
uneasily, &ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll like it here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, I think so,&rdquo; said Viola.</p>

<p>The door swung back, and the dark, stuffy
interior of the room opened before her like a
long-closed cave. She turned her cheek and
the colonel kissed it.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you think you&rsquo;ll be able to stand those
people?&rdquo; he asked, in the low tone of confidential
criticism.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;I dare say they&rsquo;ll be very nice when we get
to know them. Everybody&rsquo;s strange at first.
Good night, father.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She went in and closed the door. The aloofness
of her manner had never been more
marked. It seemed to place the colonel in the
position of a stranger to whom she preserved an
attitude of polite reticence. Feeling shrunk
and chilled, he crept away to his own room.</p>

<p>So the new life began. Everything was very
strange, and the weather was very hot. The
colonel, who had not for fifty years known a
warmer climate than San Francisco, wilted in
the furnace-like airs of the interior city. The
first burning week exhausted him as a serious
illness might have done. Viola, who had never
seen her father ill, was frightened, and sent for
a doctor. The doctor came, asked questions,
and looked wise. He said the colonel&rsquo;s heart
was weak, and that he seemed in a very debilitated
condition. A trip to the seaside would do
him good; cooler weather would brace him up.</p>

<p>When the man had gone there was a silence
between the father and daughter. Through
the drawn blinds the golden cracks of intruding
sunshine cut the dimness that Viola had
made by closing all the shutters in a futile attempt
to keep the room cool.</p>

<p>Presently she said, in a voice that she tried
to make cheerful:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;As soon as you get stronger we will go on.
It&rsquo;s too hot and uncomfortable here for any
one to stay.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Go on where?&rdquo; the colonel asked, with the
light of interest in his eyes.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Farther east. It will be cool enough there.
We can go to one of those seaside places you
read about in the papers&mdash;a cheap one, I mean.
We have plenty of money for the trip.&ldquo;</p>

<p>The colonel moved restlessly in his chair,
and finally twitched open one of the shutters.
The hot breath of the garden, laden with heavy
exotic scents, puffed in through the opening
like incense.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t take me farther away, Viola,&rdquo; he said
suddenly, in a tone like that of a querulous
child; &ldquo;don&rsquo;t take me out of California.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you want to stay here?&rdquo; she asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If we can&rsquo;t go back,&rdquo; he answered, looking
at her wistfully.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t think you minded,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I
thought you&rsquo;d like the change.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was something of the old gentle fellowship
in her tone, and it made the colonel&rsquo;s
heart expand. He held out his hand to her,
and taking her fingers, rubbed them against his
cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m too old to be transplanted now.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She stood beside him, looking down, evidently
troubled.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Some day, perhaps,&rdquo; he went on, watching
her, &ldquo;we can go back. They&rsquo;ll have forgotten
us there in a few more weeks.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He saw her face change at once, and dared
go no further.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;some day,&rdquo; she answered, and the
conversation ended.</p>

<p>The long summer burned itself on through
July into August. Glaring, golden mornings
melted into breathless noons, which smoldered
away into fiery sunsets. The leafage in the
garden hung motionless, and exhaled strange,
aromatic perfumes. In the evenings the palms
stood black against the rose-red west like
paintings of sunset in the desert. The city
they had left, wrapped in its mantle of fog, appealed
to the memories of the exiles as a dim,
lost paradise.</p>

<p>To the girl whose simple life had passed in a
seclusion almost cloistral, but at its loneliest
marked by refinement, the sudden intimacies,
the crude jovialities, of the boarding-house
were violently repelling. She shrank from
contact with her fellow-boarders, touched by,
but unresponsive to their clumsy overtures of
friendship, alarmed by their ferociously playful
personalities. Fortunately her coolness was set
down as shyness, and she suffered from none
of that rancor which the boarder who is suspected
of &ldquo;putting on frills&rdquo; is liable to rouse.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>The long, idle days seemed interminable to
her. At first she had found occupation in an
attempt to beautify the two rooms she and her
father rented. Of hers she had made a sitting-room,
transforming the bed into a divan covered
with a casing of blue denim and a heap
of shaded blue cushions. Under one of the
balconies she discovered a quantity of forgotten
flower-pots, and in these she had planted cuttings
of gay-colored geraniums, and set them
along the window-sills and the balcony-railing.
But the work was soon completed, and a second
interval of terrifying vacant hours faced her.
This time she tried to seek intellectual diversion,
and joined the free public library. She
had often secretly deplored her own ignorance;
now was the time to repair this defect; and
she carried home many serious works, great
thoughts of great minds with whom she had
never before had an opportunity of becoming
acquainted.</p>

<p>But poor Viola was not of the women who
find in the exercise of the brain a method
of healing the hurts of a wounded heart. At
times a sense of piercing misery possessed her.
There were hours when her loneliness pressed
upon her like a weight, when the sense of what
she had lost was unbearable as a fierce, continuous
pain. Then, in the hope of escaping from
the torment of &ldquo;remembering happier things,&rdquo;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span>she went out and, in the blistering heat under
which the streets lay sweltering, walked aimlessly.
If fatigue overcame her she sat down
on one of the benches in the little plazas that
dot the city, and there a graceful, listless figure
slipped back over the intervening gulf to the
days when the sunshine had been bright and
her own heart was full of it.</p>

<p>Sometimes rebellion against the fate which
had shut her out from happiness rose within
her. A beloved companionship, no matter at
what cost, was better than this waste of desolation.
One life is all of which we are sure; why
not, then, seize what we can of that one? How
terrible, in the darkness of death, to realize
that we have lost all that might have made this
world so rich and sweet! Oh, the frightful
thoughts of seeing at the end that we have relinquished
joy and love for a dream, for nothing!
For the first time in a life singularly free from
event or developing experience, she met that
dark second self which dwells in each of us.</p>

<p>So the tempter whispered his old words.
She closed her ears to them with fear and aversion.
But they returned, coming upon her
persuasively in moments of deadly depression
and disgust of life, coming upon her with comforting
declarations of harmlessness, coming
upon her with challenging queries as to their
wrong.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p>One evening they were more convincing than
they had ever been before. Sitting alone in
her own room after dinner, Viola listened, for
the first time hesitating. Where would be the
wrong in writing to him&mdash;just a line to tell
him she was sorry they had gone without seeing
him? Common politeness would seem to
suggest that she ought to do that. She would
have done it before, only&mdash;only&mdash; She rose
from her seat and, going to the window, looked
down into the dark recesses of the garden,
whence small rustling noises rose, then upward
to the clear pink of the sunset, cut with black
palm-spikes. He, once their best friend!
What excuse was there for slighting a friend?</p>

<p>She turned from the window suddenly and
went to the table where her writing-materials
were kept. A sheet of note-paper lay ready on
the blotter. It shone pink in the sunset light
as she drew it toward her. Her hand trembled
a little as she dipped the pen in the ink, but was
firm when she wrote her letter. There were
only a few lines, and of the most commonplace
description. In the barest words she accounted
for their sudden departure, made an apologetic
allusion to their not having acquainted him
with their intention of leaving, and ended with
the words, &ldquo;I hope we shall some day see you
again.&rdquo; At the end of the letter she wrote the
address, and upon this expended some care,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>forming the numbers with exactness, and inscribing
the name of the street with slow clearness.
She sealed the envelop with nervous
haste, and was rising from her chair when the
colonel entered.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Been writing letters?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>The question was not an idle one, for letter-writing
was seldom practised in that small
family circle.</p>

<p>Instinctively Viola placed her hand over the
envelop as it lay on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said hurriedly, &ldquo;just a note.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom to?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Oh, I suppose your
friend at the Woman&rsquo;s Exchange.&rdquo; This was
a girl Viola had spoken of writing to anent the
relinquishing of her work.</p>

<p>Viola made no answer. The old man, who
was lighting the lamp, did not appear to notice
her silence.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Letter-writing&rsquo;s not much in my line,&rdquo; he
said absently, &ldquo;but your mother wrote beautiful
letters.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Whom to?&rdquo; said the girl, in her turn.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Me, when we were lovers.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The lamp was lit, and he charily placed the
globe on it. As he did so, Viola, from behind
him, leaned forward and applied the letter,
twisted into a spiral, to the chimney. It
smoked, charred, and then went up in a flicker
of flame.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you doing?&rdquo; he asked, staring at
her in surprise.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Burning my letter.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. Perhaps because I don&rsquo;t write
beautiful ones like my mother.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her voice trembled, broke, and she burst into
wild tears. The door into the room beyond
was open, and she ran through the aperture
and shut the door behind her.</p>

<p>The colonel stood looking after her, amazed,
alarmed, uncomprehending. In the old days he
would have followed her. Now he stood listening
at the closed door, not daring even to
knock. When he heard her sobbing cease he
came tiptoeing away as though afraid of reawakening
her drowsing grief. Standing by
the table, he looked long and ruefully at the
lamp-globe.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Poor little girl!&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s
homesick, too.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man&rsquo;s own homesickness was an incurable
malady. As he had said himself, he
was too old for transplanting. He could not
shake himself down in the new rut. He could
not get accustomed to the strange city and its
unfamiliar thoroughfares. Its alien aspect
seemed to force in upon him the sense of his
insignificance and failure. He walked along
the streets and no one knew him. There were
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>no cheery voices to cry out, &ldquo;So long, colonel,&rdquo;
and wave a welcoming hand to a hat-brim.
People jostled him to one side, seeing only a
thin, threadbare old man in a faded coat. He
had no consciousness that they would turn and
look at him, and point him out to the stranger
from the East whom they were &ldquo;taking round.&rdquo;
He was no more to Sacramento than it was to
him. He grew so to dread the feeling of oppressive
melancholy that fell upon him in its
unfriendly streets that he gave up going out,
and spent most of his time in the garden or in
Viola&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>When with her he tried to be bright and to
make the best of the situation. He saw in her
changed attitude nothing but blame of him,
and he would have borne anything uncomplainingly
to win back the love he thought she withheld.
That another and a deeper feeling could
be causing her heaviness of spirit he did not
dream. Like many another man, he had no
instinct to see into the hidden inner life of the
child that was bone of his bone and flesh of his
flesh.</p>

<p>He hardly ever let his thoughts revert to the
cause that had made her take her hasty step.
He knew he had been to blame, and the colonel
was a man who always forgot his own mistakes.
In the course of time they ceased to be mistakes,
and, in his eyes, assumed the proportions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>of worthy attempts that an unjust fate had
frustrated. Just what he had meant by using
his daughter&rsquo;s name in his intercourse with
Gault he himself hardly knew&mdash;nothing to her
actual detriment, that was certain. If any one
had breathed a word of blame against her, or
tried to harm one hair of her head, he would
have been quick to rise in her defense, wrathful
as a tiger. The wrongs that do not come directly
back, like boomerangs, were wrongs the responsibility
of which the colonel readily shifted from
his shoulders. He had wanted money for Viola,
and he used the readiest means to his hand to
get it. The jingling of gold in his pocket, the
gladness of her face when he brought her some
trifling gift, made everything outside the pleasure
of the moment count for naught.</p>

<p>And now they were estranged. A veil of indissoluble
coldness separated them. Yet she
was never curt or sharp or cross to him.
Sometimes it seemed to him that she was the
same in word and voice and manner as she had
always been, only something had gone from
her&mdash;light, cheer, gaiety, some inexpressible,
loving, lovely thing that had made her the star
of his life. Once, taking his courage in both
hands, he had asked her if she was angry with
him, and then shrank like a whipped dog before
the startled negation of her eyes and her
quick &ldquo;Why, no, father! How could I be?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>The one diversion of the colonel&rsquo;s life was
the society of his fellow-boarders. Though he
abused them roundly up-stairs to Viola, he took
undoubted satisfaction in regaling them with
the stories of his past greatness. Night after
night he bestrode his hobby, and entertained
an admiring circle with its evolutions. It was
many years since he had had so large and so attentive
an audience, and he profited by the occasion,
giving even more remarkable accounts
of the men he had made than those with which
he had once amused John Gault.</p>

<p>For some time his listeners awarded him a
half-credulous attention; but soon their interest
in the garrulous old man died away. Miss
Mercer expressed the opinion that the colonel
was &ldquo;no better than an old, worn-out fake,&rdquo; a
sentiment which found an echo in the breasts
of every other inmate of the house&mdash;even Mrs.
Seymour quietly, in her own mind, relegating
him to the ranks of harmless frauds. The traditions
of San Francisco were not known of all
men in Sacramento. The colonel found that he
was singing the songs of Zion in a strange land.
No one believed him. When he spoke of his
friendship with Adolphus Maroney, and how
thirty years before he had laid the foundation
of Jerry McCormick&rsquo;s fortune, the listeners
made little attempt to hide their disbelief, and
Mr. Betts and Charley Ryan took much delight
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span>in openly &ldquo;joshing the old man.&rdquo; Bart Nelson
did not indulge in this pastime, as he had conceived
a violent, if secret, regard for Viola.</p>

<p>One evening after dinner the &ldquo;joshing&rdquo;
reached a climax against which even the
colonel&rsquo;s egotistical infatuation was not proof.
Viola was up-stairs, according to her custom;
Mrs. Seymour was absent on her never-ending
household duties; and Bart Nelson was out.
There was no one to restrain the old man&rsquo;s
foolish flights, and inspired by the ironically
flattering queries of his listeners, his reminiscences
became more vaingloriously brilliant
than they had ever been before.</p>

<p>His completion of an elaborate account of
his patronage of Adolphus Maroney called
forth from Mr. Betts the remark:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see, colonel, how he can get on at
all without you. Once you got from under
him, it&rsquo;s a miracle he didn&rsquo;t entirely collapse.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, not quite that,&rdquo; the colonel modestly
deprecated. &ldquo;Maroney was no fool&mdash;no fool;
only speculative and lacking in foresight. When
I got him on his feet he was able to go his way
alone.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that was smart of him, wasn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
commented Charley Ryan, with a sagacious wag
of his head.</p>

<p>There was something in the tone of his remark
that disturbed the colonel&rsquo;s complacency.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>For a moment he eyed Charley with a side
glance, then he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m always willing to admit that Maroney
was no fool.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, how do we know,&rdquo; said Miss Mercer,
letting her eyes give a preliminary sweep over
the faces about her, &ldquo;that you&rsquo;re not still
doing all the work and making all the money
for those San Francisco millionaires? You
know, I believe that&rsquo;s just what you&rsquo;re up to,
and you&rsquo;re too sly to tell.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She looked at him with an air of bright challenge.
The colonel was pleased.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, my dear young lady,&rdquo; he answered;
&ldquo;that was in the past, when I was one of them
myself.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Are you sure you are not one of them still?&rdquo;
said Charley Ryan. &ldquo;Come, now, colonel;
make a clean breast of it. Here&rsquo;s the family
album; can you swear upon this book that you
haven&rsquo;t got a few loose millions lying round
in tea-pots and stockings up in your room?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel flushed. He did not mind alluding
to his poverty himself, but he resented having
others treat it as a jest.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can swear without family albums that the
fortune I once had is a thing of the past,&rdquo; he
answered, &ldquo;and I rather fancy that you know
all about its magnitude and its loss. Most
people do.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>This was too much. Mr. Betts, who was
afflicted by an irrepressible sense of humor,
burst into loud laughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, colonel,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;now that you remind
me, I believe I have heard that there was
a hitch about your millions. So there is about
mine. Yours are gone, and mine ain&rsquo;t come.
Brothers in misfortune! Shake on that!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He held out a large fist, and the colonel, not
quite comprehending, but feeling the derision
about him in an inward sense of heated discomfort,
put his hand in it. Mr. Betts gave it
a vigorous clasp, and holding it aloft, said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The Corsican Brothers!&mdash;as they appeared
at that fatal moment when one had just lost
and the other not yet found his pile.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a shout of laughter, and the old
man drew his hand away. His face was deeply
flushed, and a feeling of tremulous indignation
was rising in him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t despond, colonel,&rdquo; said Miss Mercer,
cheerily. &ldquo;Lots of men have made two fortunes.
There&rsquo;s a chance for you yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I guess there&rsquo;s about as much chance for
him,&rdquo; said Mrs. Betts, who was an acidulous
lady of a practical turn, &ldquo;as there is for Mr.
Betts. I&rsquo;m sorter tired of this talk of making
millions, and then never having an extra dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Stick close to the colonel, Mrs. Betts,&rdquo; said
Charley Ryan, &ldquo;and you&rsquo;ll have your extra
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span>dollar. He&rsquo;ll make it for you same way as he
did for Jerry McCormick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Now, colonel,&rdquo; said Mr. Betts, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s a
chance for you. Here&rsquo;s Mrs. Betts wants an
extra dollar, and here are you, just the man
to make it for her. No gentleman can resist
the appeal of a female in distress. Send my
henchman for ink and paper.&rdquo; He drew a stub
of pencil from his pocket and began writing on
the back of an envelop, reading as he wrote:
&ldquo;Colonel Reed, the multi-millionaire, will before
the present witnesses sign a contract to
make for the hereinbefore-mentioned Mary
Louise Betts the sum of one dollar, the same
payable on&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>He paused with raised pencil.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What date did you say?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel rose. He was pale and almost
gasping with anger. He had at last realized
that these barbarians were making sport of him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I did not state any date,&rdquo; he said slowly;
&ldquo;nor did I&mdash;that I can remember&mdash;say that I
would make any specified sum of money for
any one here. But since you seem to insist that
I did so, I will fulfil my obligations without
any more unnecessary talk. Here is the dollar.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He drew a dollar from his pocket and flung
it on the table with the gesture of one throwing
a bone to a dog.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Ladies,&rdquo; he said, bowing deeply to the two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span>women, &ldquo;I have the honor to wish you good
evening.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was a moment of silence after his
withdrawal, during which they all sat staring
rather foolishly at the dollar. But if he had
thought to humiliate them, he had mistaken
his audience.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There, now!&rdquo; was the opening remark, contributed
by Mrs. Betts; &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve gone and
rubbed him up the wrong way. And I don&rsquo;t
see what satisfaction you get from it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mr. Betts, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get the dollar,
anyway.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He made a playfully frenzied lunge for the
coin. But Charley Ryan had anticipated the
movement, and his hand struck it first. An
animated tussle ensued, during which Miss
Mercer averted a catastrophe by removing the
lamp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord! Lord!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Betts, querulously,
&ldquo;what under the canopy possesses them?
It&rsquo;s like living in a bear-garden.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The struggle ended with the triumph of
Charley Ryan, who, with an exaggerated bow
and an affectation of the colonel&rsquo;s manner,
presented his trophy to Mrs. Betts. She took
it, threw it into her work-basket, and said
snappishly:</p>

<p>&ldquo;The old man gets that to-morrow. I ain&rsquo;t
goin&rsquo; into the hold-up business.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span></p>

<p>After this the colonel&rsquo;s attitude toward his
fellow-boarders was of the stillest and most repelling
sort. They were a good deal surprised
at it at first; then, as days passed and it did not
soften, they came to regard it as a joke, and
though by tacit consent he was let alone, they
seemed to harbor no ill feeling toward him. He,
on his side, was filled with unappeasable rage.
He often passed a meal without speaking to one
of them, and never again spent an evening in
the parlor.</p>

<p>Up-stairs he abused them to Viola with a
violence of phrase that would have amazed
them. Even to Mrs. Seymour he permitted
himself to indulge his wrath to the extent of
biting sarcasms at their expense. The landlady
soothed him by assuring him that they
were of an inferior class to himself. This was
some consolation to the colonel, but he avoided
their society with a hauteur which was quite
thrown away on them, and his life became lonelier
and more purposeless than ever.</p>

<p>Cut off still further from his fellows, longing
for, yet afraid to court, the society of his
daughter, the old man found himself in a position
of distressing isolation. In his dreariness
he turned for amusement and solace to the one
person left in the house who had neither the
self-consciousness to bore, the experience to
judge by, nor the cruelty to mock. This was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>Corinne, Mrs. Seymour&rsquo;s little girl, a grave,
large-eyed, lean-shanked child of eight.</p>

<p>The alternate spoiling and scolding that the
boarders awarded her had developed in Corinne
a chill disbelief in human nature. As a rule
she held off from those about her who would
one day buy her kisses with a bag of candy,
and the next, when she was singing to her
doll on the balcony, would box her ears for
making a noise. The vagaries of humanity
were a mystery to her, and she had already acquired
a cautious philosophy, the main tenet of
which was to go her own way without demand
or appeal to her fellow-creatures.</p>

<p>Corinne, if not as experienced as her mother,
was possessed of those intuitive faculties which
distinguish many neglected children. She
knew after the first week that neither the colonel
nor Viola would blow hot and cold upon
her little moods. Still, there was a prudent
reticence in her acceptance of their overtures,
and she took the colonel&rsquo;s first gifts of fruit
and candy with a wary apprehension of the next
day&rsquo;s rebuffs. But they never came, and the
prematurely grave child and the lonely old
man established friendly relations, grateful and
warming to both. Finally, when the other
boarders drove the colonel back into the citadel
of his wounded pride, the tie between them
was strengthened. Each felt the isolation of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[Pg 210]</a></span>the other as a secret bond of sympathy and
understanding.</p>

<p>The colonel, sore, homesick, repulsed on
every side, turned to the child with a pitiful
eagerness, and lavished upon her the discarded
affections of his hungry heart. He greeted her
entrance into Viola&rsquo;s sitting-room&mdash;a noiseless
entrance, hugging up to her breast her doll and
her pet black kitten&mdash;with expressions of joy
that to an outsider would have seemed laughably
extravagant. But they were not, for she
had come to represent to him tenderness, tolerance,
appreciation. He felt at ease and contented
with her, for he knew that she would
not criticize him, would never find fault with
him. She flattered and sustained the last remnant
of his once buoyant vanity. He was not
afraid that her eyes would meet his with a sad
reproach. On the contrary, their absorbed unconsciousness
was one of the most soothing and
delightful things about her. Corinne would
not have cared what he did. She liked him for
himself, and accepted him unmurmuringly as
he was.</p>

<p>It was holiday-time, and she spent many
afternoons in the colonel&rsquo;s society, generally
squatted on the floor in Viola&rsquo;s sitting-room.
She spoke little, but had the appearance of listening
to all the old man said, and at times
made solemnly sagacious comments. He, on his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>part, talked to her as if she had been a woman,
expatiating to her on the strange capriciousness
of affection that marked her sex. Once or
twice he alluded sadly to the apparent estrangement
between himself and his daughter.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Seems almost as if she didn&rsquo;t like me, Corinne;
doesn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo; he asked anxiously, watching
the child, who was trying to put her doll&rsquo;s
skirt on the kitten.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think so,&rdquo; Corinne responded
gravely, holding the cat on its hind legs while
she shook down the skirt; &ldquo;I think she likes
you a lot.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What makes you think that? She doesn&rsquo;t
ever talk to me much, or tell me things, the
way she used.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She doesn&rsquo;t talk to anybody much,&rdquo; said
Corinne. &ldquo;Mr. Nelson said she was the most
awful quiet girl he ever knew.&rdquo; Here the cat
gave a long, protesting mew, and Corinne&rsquo;s attention
became concentrated on its toilet.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She usen&rsquo;t to be quiet like that. She was
the brightest girl! You ought to have seen
her, Corinne&mdash;just like a picture, and always
laughing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She don&rsquo;t laugh much now,&rdquo; said Corinne;
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think I ever heard her laugh&mdash;not once.
Keep quiet now, deary&rdquo;&mdash;coaxingly to the cat;
&ldquo;you&rsquo;re nearly dressed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;And all because I only tried to please her.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>I just tried to do my best to make her happy.
There&rsquo;s no good trying to please a woman.
You&rsquo;re all the same. Be kind to them, be loving,
break your heart trying to give them
pleasure&mdash;and that&rsquo;s the way it is.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the way it is?&rdquo; asked Corinne, sitting
up on her heels and feeling over her person
for a pin to fasten the waistband of the skirt.</p>

<p>&ldquo;The way it is now with me and Viola&mdash;coldness,
indifference, maybe dislike.&rdquo; Then, half
to himself: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no understanding women.
What were they made for, anyway?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Corinne seemed to think this remark worthy
of attention. Her search for the pin was arrested
and she pondered for a moment. Then
she looked at the colonel and said tentatively,
not quite sure of the reasonableness of her
reply:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I suppose so that people can have mothers,
colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;So that people can have love, Corinne,&rdquo; he
answered sadly.</p>

<p>Corinne, feeling that her solution of the
problem had not been the right one, returned
to the pin. She found it, and bending over
the patient kitten, inserted it carefully into the
band. But her calculations were not true, the
pin pricked, and the cat, with an angry mew,
broke away and went scuttling across the room
inclosed in the skirt. Her appearance was so
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>funny that Corinne sat back on her heels and,
punching the colonel&rsquo;s knee, cried in a burst of
laughter:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, look, colonel, look! Ain&rsquo;t she cunning?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel looked. The cat turned, still
in the skirt, and eyed them both with a look
of hurt protest. It appealed to the colonel&rsquo;s
humor as it had to Corinne&rsquo;s. Their combined
laughter filled the room and greeted Viola as
she came up the passage from one of her long
walks.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What are you laughing at?&rdquo; she asked, as
she opened the door and entered like a pale
vision wilted with the heat and light outside.</p>

<p>The colonel&rsquo;s laughter died away immediately.
Her listless air of delicacy struck him
anew with the silent reproach which her mere
presence now seemed to suggest. All amusement
faded from his face, and he looked guiltily
conscious, like a child found in mischief.</p>

<p>A short time after this a hot spell struck the
city. Though it was September, the heat was
stifling. For three days the mercury stood so
high that even Corinne&rsquo;s engrossingly arduous
play with the doll and the kitten was listlessly
performed, and she spent most of her time in
the sitting-room with Viola and the colonel,
where, behind closed shutters, they gasped
away the hours. The old man seemed to feel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>the heat less than before; at least, he said little
about it, and occupied himself in teaching Corinne
to play solitaire, a game for which she
evinced a precocious aptitude. Viola, sitting
by the window, where now and then a fine edge
of warm air sifted in between the slats in the
shutters, watched them. Her father seemed as
much interested as the child, and the girl wondered
how in this oppressive exile he could
have spirit for so trivial an amusement.</p>

<p>After three days the heat broke, and was
succeeded by a soothing, balmy coolness, under
the influence of which the city seemed to relax
and rest inert in the torpor of recuperation.
The freshened airs that flowed through the
overheated old house extracted every odor left
from years of bad cooking and insufficient ventilation.
The musty hangings of the rooms
closed in and held the oven-like atmosphere.
Dusty curtains and grease-stained carpets
added their contributions to the closeness left
by years of untidy occupancy.</p>

<p>Viola had spent the morning in the garden,
sitting under the great fig-tree, sewing. The
house was unbearable to her, and she wondered
why her father had chosen to remain there,
working methodically over an old solitaire he
was trying to recall. Late in the afternoon,
her work done, she resolved to go out for a
walk. Entering the sitting-room with her hat
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span>and gloves in her hand, she found the colonel
still sitting at the table, upon which the cards
were arranged in twelve neat piles. He had
mastered the solitaire, and now refused to accompany
her on the ground that he had an
engagement to teach it to Corinne, who had
that day gone to school for the first time. He
seemed to be looking forward to the few hours
of the child&rsquo;s society that the afternoon would
give him, and had set forth on a corner of
the table a little feast of cookies and fruit with
which to regale her when the solitaire became
irksome. Viola was not sorry that he would
not come. She liked being alone, with nothing
to interrupt the aimless flow of her thoughts.</p>

<p>The air was clear, fresh, and fine. The languor
of the warm weather was gone, and the
girl, as she fared toward one of the little plazas
which at intervals interrupt the passage of the
long streets, felt the promise of autumn. Sitting
on a bench in the plaza, she looked out
over the city, and caught a glimpse of the
sparkle of the river at the end of an open vista,
and, cutting into the thin pink of the sunset
sky, roof beyond roof and chimney over chimney.
The golden dreaminess of summer was
over, with its brooding, purposeless inaction.
The haze of churned-up yellow dust, was dispersed
by a breath that held a prophecy of
coming cold, sharp and imperious. There was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span>a stir in the air, a promise in the flaring sky.
Its light fell on Viola&rsquo;s face, and seemed to suddenly
send a shaft into her deadened heart.
She moved and looked up, almost as if some
one had spoken to her. On the pallor of her
lifted face the reflected glow shone like gilding.</p>

<p>The dead lethargy that had held her all summer
seemed to be breaking. As she sat staring
at the illuminated sky, her mind sprang back
like a mended spring, past all the despair and
struggle of the past three months to the life
behind it, and then forward to the future. A
rousing of energy, a sense of work to do, a return
of force and will, ran through her in a
brisk, revivifying current. The checked stream
of her life seemed to burst the barrier that had
held it and to move onward again.</p>

<p>There was work for every one, and work was
the purpose of existence. She had claimed
happiness as a right, demanded what is not to
be; then, when the inexorable ruling will had
interposed, had dropped from the ranks in the
passion of a thwarted child. The glory and
the dream&mdash;who realized them? Who of the
millions about her had touched the happiness
she had expected to seize and hold? Why
should she be exempt from the grinding that
forces the grain from the chaff? All yearned,
aspired, dreamed, and yet, never achieving,
lived on, learning their lesson of obedience.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span>Only some bowed their necks to the yoke more
quickly than others.</p>

<p>There was a second plane of life&mdash;a plane to
which some were rudely hurled and some crept
by degrees. Here you went sternly on, and did
the work before you for its own sake, not for
yours. And thus, in time, self might be conquered
and its insistent cry for recognition be
stifled. There was a corner in the world for
every one, where they took their broken idols
and set them up, and some day would look at
them and smile over the anguish there had
been when they fell.</p>

<p>The sunset deepened to a fine, transparent
red, which looked as if it had been clarified of
all denser matter. It gave a flush to Viola&rsquo;s
upward-looking face. Her thoughts turned
from the vague lines they had been following to
closer personal ones. The love for her father,
that had seemed frozen, gushed up in her heart.
His face, with its wistful glance, came before
her; a hundred instances of her past coldness
rose in accusing memory. There was something
better yet than work. Love&mdash;that was
the axis of the world; that made life possible,
and the sacrifice of self full of use and meaning;
that was the key-note of the whole structure of
existence.</p>

<p>She rose to her feet, and rapidly, with her
old firm alertness of step, moved out through
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>the plaza. She wanted to run, to find the old
man and, taking his head in her arms, whisper
her contrition. Through street after street her
swift footfall woke sharp, decisive echoes. Her
face had lost its look of dejection and was set
in lines of firmness and resolution. People, as
she passed, turned to look at her&mdash;at the young
face so full of a steady purpose, at the eyes
deep with a woman&rsquo;s aspirations. Her thoughts
flew forward, high-strung, exalted, beating
against the confining limits of time and space.
She would take him back to San Francisco.
They would go together. How had she had
the heart to hurt him so! Now, all blindness
swept away by the breaking down of her egotism,
she knew what he had suffered.</p>

<p>It was almost dark when she reached the
house, and as she went up the path from the
gate she saw lights springing out here and
there in the upper windows. In the passage
to her own room she came upon Mrs. Seymour
lighting the gas, her back toward the stair-head.
The elder woman, hearing the girl&rsquo;s
light step, turned with the match in her hand.
Viola, still engrossed in her own thoughts, mechanically
smiled a greeting. Mrs. Seymour&rsquo;s
face, with the crude gaslight falling on it, was
unresponsively grave.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m glad that&rsquo;s you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve had
a sort of scare about your father.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Scare!&rdquo; exclaimed Viola, stopping with a
start. &ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Nothing for you to get frightened about.
It&rsquo;s all over now. He had a sort of a sinking
spell, that was all, when he was playing them
cards with Corinne. She come out and hollered
for me, and I come up and found him
looking white and kind o&rsquo; queerish. He said
he&rsquo;d only lost his breath. I gave him some
brandy, and it seemed to pull him together all
right. But I didn&rsquo;t, some way or other, like his
looks. I sorter wished you was here.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola looked relieved.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, he&rsquo;s had that several times before.
It&rsquo;s his heart, the doctor said; but he didn&rsquo;t
seem to think it was anything serious. You
frightened me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour walked down the hall to the
gas-jet by the stair-head.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want to get frightened,&rdquo; she said
over her shoulder; &ldquo;but I don&rsquo;t think you
know much about sickness, and, if I was you,
I&rsquo;d get the doctor to-morrow.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll do that anyway,&rdquo; said Viola, as she
opened the door of the colonel&rsquo;s room.</p>

<p>The picture that she entered upon was reassuring.
The lamp was lighted under its opaque
yellow shade, and cast its chastened light over
the center of the room. Here Corinne lay on
the floor, the pack of cards spread out before
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span>her. In the intensity of her absorption she
kicked gently on the floor with her toes, making
a soft but regular tattoo. Near by sat the
kitten, its tail curled neatly round its front feet,
ink-black save for the transparent yellow-green
of its large watching eyes. The colonel leaned
over the arm of his chair, following the game as
intently as the child. He was laughing when
Viola came in, and pointing with a long forefinger
at a possible move that Corinne had not
seen. Both were so interested in their play
that they did not heed the opening of the door.
Viola stood in the aperture, regarding them
with pleasure and relief. A slight smell of
brandy in the air was the only indication that
there had been sickness here a short time
before.</p>

<p>At the sound of the closing of the door they
both looked up. Over the colonel&rsquo;s visage the
same childishly embarrassed expression flitted
that Viola had noticed a few days before.
Corinne, on the contrary, merely gave the newcomer
the short side look of begrudged attention,
and returned to the cards, murmuring,
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s only Viola.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The girl went across to her father, and taking
his hand, curled her soft fingers around it
in a warm, infolding clasp.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Seymour says you haven&rsquo;t been well,&rdquo;
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>The unexpected caress made the old man forget
the game, and his face flushed with pleasure.
He leaned toward her with the content
of a forgiven child.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It was nothing&mdash;just a little turn like I had
the other day. First a pain, and then something
comes fluttering up near your throat. The heat
knocked me out. But it scared Corinne.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He got the color of the pitcher,&rdquo; said Corinne,
not moving her eyes from the cards, but
sparing enough time to give a jerk of her head
in the direction of a white china water-pitcher
on the table.</p>

<p>&ldquo;You ought to have seen Corinne. She went
out in the passage and made a noise as if there
was a fire.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I was scairt,&rdquo; said Corinne, &ldquo;and hollered
for mommer. I don&rsquo;t want you to scare me
that way again, colonel.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The colonel and Viola laughed.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll try and not have it happen again,&rdquo; said
the old man. &ldquo;You know, I always do what
you tell me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mostly always,&rdquo; Corinne absently agreed.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to put this ten-spot here. Look,
colonel, isn&rsquo;t that the best move?&rdquo;</p>

<p>The old man leaned forward, studying the
contemplated move. Viola drew back, watching
him. She had noticed his pallor when she came
in. Now his face, settled into lines of gravity,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[Pg 222]</a></span>appeared to have suddenly collapsed and withered
into the gray hollows of decrepitude. Her
heart contracted at the sight. She turned away,
under the pretense of pulling off her gloves, and
said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I made a plan when I was out this afternoon.
I think you&rsquo;ll like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Let&rsquo;s hear it,&rdquo; he said, turning back from
the cards and watching her with a fond half-smile.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Something I think you&rsquo;ll like&mdash;oh, ever so
much!&rdquo; She patted and pinched the limp
gloves into shape, not looking at him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Hit me with it,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mrs. Seymour&rsquo;s
just given me that glass half full of brandy;
you can&rsquo;t expect me to guess after that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;That we should go back to San Francisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Her news had more effect than even she had
expected. The colonel sat up as if he had been
struck, his lips quivering into a smile that he
feared to indulge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Do you mean that, Viola? Do you really
mean it?&rdquo; he asked.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course I do. I thought you&rsquo;d like it.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But do you like it? Do you want to go?
Isn&rsquo;t there&mdash;wouldn&rsquo;t you rather stay here?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no.&rdquo; She struck lightly on the edge of
the table with the gloves, avoiding his eyes.
&ldquo;I&rsquo;d rather be there. We&rsquo;ve had our little
change, and we can go back. It&rsquo;s our home,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>anyway; and we&rsquo;ve enough money to last
for a long time yet.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Of course we have, and it doesn&rsquo;t matter if
we haven&rsquo;t.&rdquo; The old man&rsquo;s face burned with
excitement and joy. &ldquo;But the house is sold!
Where shall we go? Oh, that doesn&rsquo;t matter,
either. We can get rooms near there. You&rsquo;d
like to be back near the old place, wouldn&rsquo;t you?
We could go to Mrs. Cassidy&rsquo;s; you know she
rents her two back rooms on the second floor.
Oh, Viola&mdash;to be back again!&rdquo;</p>

<p>He sank back in his chair, his eyes half shut
in the ecstasy of this sudden restoration to
happiness.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Just think of it!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;To see the bay
again, and Lotta&rsquo;s Fountain, and Montgomery
Street! and to smell the sea outside the Golden
Gate when the wind&rsquo;s that way! and to feel
the fog! Viola, you don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;ve
suffered. I never meant to tell you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know&mdash;I know now. But I didn&rsquo;t guess
at first&mdash;truly, father, I didn&rsquo;t know at first.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why, of course not, honey&mdash;how should
you? And it doesn&rsquo;t matter now. It&rsquo;s all
over, and we&rsquo;re going to have the time of our
lives. But it was awful, wasn&rsquo;t it? Everything
was so lonesome and strange. And those
dreadful people! But we won&rsquo;t have any more
bother with them. When&rsquo;ll we start? Let&rsquo;s
not waste any time.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span></p>

<p>Viola had turned away to the tall glass behind
him, under the pretense of taking off her
hat. She could not control her tears. As she
stood, seeing her blurred image dark against the
lamplight, she could hear the colonel babbling
on, apparently too preoccupied to notice that
she was not answering:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;ll be warm when we get back&mdash;not this
diabolical heat, but just soft and sunny. The
hills will be all brown. Presently there&rsquo;ll be
a smell of eucalyptus in the air, but that won&rsquo;t
be till later, when the evenings are short. Oh,
I&rsquo;m so glad we&rsquo;re going back! It&rsquo;s like getting
out of prison.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was suddenly silent, and Viola heard him
making a slight rustling movement in his chair.
Then the room was very quiet, for Corinne had
stopped beating with her toes. For a space
Viola struggled with herself, biting her lips,
and surreptitiously taking out her handkerchief
and pressing it against her face. She was
more afraid of the piercing eyes of Corinne
than of her father, and when she had controlled
herself sufficiently to be presentable, she
looked in the mirror to see if Corinne had been
observing her. Instead, she saw the child
standing up some few steps away from the
colonel, regarding him with an expression of
keen, suspended intentness that was at once
curious and fearful.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span></p>

<p>As Viola&rsquo;s eyes encountered the reflection,
and read in it terror and alarm, Corinne spoke
in a quick, frightened voice:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look at the colonel, Viola. He looks so
queer. I don&rsquo;t like him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola was at his side before the child had
ceased speaking.</p>

<p>The colonel&rsquo;s head had dropped forward on
his breast. A yellowish, waxen hue had spread
over his face, and his eyes, cold and brooding,
were staring straight before him.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Father!&rdquo; she said, touching his hand with a
strange fearfulness she had never felt before.</p>

<p>The word sounded portentously loud in the
deep, mysterious stillness that had settled on
the room. Awe of something majestic and
terrible clutched Viola&rsquo;s heart. As she stood
staring, she heard the child screaming down
the hall:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mommer! Mommer! the colonel&rsquo;s sick
again, and his eyes are open. Oh, come quick&mdash;come
quick!&rdquo;</p>

<p>A moment later Mrs. Seymour&rsquo;s heavy footfall
sounded at the doorway, and she entered
panting. As her glance fell on the colonel, she
gave a sharp sound.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; whispered Viola, her tongue
suddenly dry and stiff as a piece of leather.
&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t speak.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Mrs. Seymour stepped forward, and laying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>her hand on the colonel&rsquo;s eyes, softly closed
the lids.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He won&rsquo;t never speak no more, my dear,&rdquo;
she said gently.</p>

<p>Viola looked at her with a wild and terrified
face.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, no, Mrs. Seymour!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;Oh,
no&mdash;oh, not that! We were just going away&mdash;we
were going home! Oh, it couldn&rsquo;t be that;
it&rsquo;s too cruel, it&rsquo;s too unnecessary. He wanted
so to go! There was no harm in it. Why
couldn&rsquo;t they have waited till we&rsquo;d got
home?&rdquo;</p>

<p>She raised her hands to her head in a gesture
of dazed despair, and fell senseless into Mrs.
Seymour&rsquo;s arms.</p>

<h2 id="VII">VII</h2></div>

<p class="no-indent"><span class="dropcap">O</span>NE week from the day Viola had told her
father of their contemplated return to
San Francisco, Colonel Reed had passed into a
memory.</p>

<p>Death had come and gone so quickly&mdash;so terribly,
bewilderingly quickly! Viola had hardly
realized what had happened to so check and
change the current of her life when the days
had already sprung back to their monotonous
routine, and the other boarders had laid aside
the expressions of lugubrious solemnity which
they had worn while death had hushed the
house. Now, while she sat still and stupid in
her room up-stairs, they told funny stories and
&ldquo;joshed&rdquo; each other at dinner, as they had
&ldquo;joshed&rdquo; the old pioneer a few weeks before.
Even Corinne had returned to the doll and the
kitten, though, out of consideration for Viola,
she played with them furtively on the corner
of the balcony, where, with the assistance of an
old umbrella and a pair of towels, she had
built herself what she called a house. One
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>morning, stepping out upon the balcony, Viola
came upon the child lying face downward and
whispering to herself while she played the solitaire
the colonel had taught her, with the pack
of cards he had bought for her a few days before
his death.</p>

<p>The waters of oblivion had closed without a
ripple over the old pioneer. In the dingy
boarding-house where he had spent the last
months of his life his name was unknown, and
his fellow-lodgers had come to regard the personal
part of his reminiscences as figments of
his imagination. So obscure had been his situation,
so little trusted his own words, that his
passing had not even been awarded the short
newspaper notice that is evoked by the death
of the most commonplace forty-niner. In the
Sacramento boarding-house Colonel Reed was
as a stranger in a strange land. Only his
daughter, Mrs. Seymour, and Bart Nelson were
the mourners at the funeral of the man who
had once been one of the most extravagant
and picturesque figures of California&rsquo;s brilliant
youth.</p>

<p>At the end of the week Viola was to return
to San Francisco. In her heart-sickness and
desolation she had turned to her home as a cat
does. After the first stunned bewilderment
she woke to a sense of loneliness that chilled
her to the marrow. The world seemed terribly
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>wide and menacing as she stood thus hesitating
on its verge. For the first time in her life she
realized what it meant to be alone, to be thrown
into that great maelstrom without a hand to
hold or a shoulder to lean on.</p>

<p>She had no intimates&mdash;few acquaintances,
even. The houses and streets of San Francisco
came to her mind with a more friendly aspect
than the people. Mrs. Seymour had asked her
if she should write to any one. She had answered
that there was no one to write to. The
good-natured landlady had gazed at the girl&mdash;looking
so slight and pale in her somber draperies&mdash;with
a frowning and fidgeted anxiety.
She thought it a very hazardous thing to let
this delicate creature, still half stupefied by a
sudden blow, go away alone and unprotected
into a city of strangers. But Viola insisted.
To herself she kept reiterating, &ldquo;I want to go
home.&rdquo; It seemed to her as if the gaunt, gray
city, crowded on its wind-swept hills, would
welcome her with the silent, understanding love
of a mother. It was the one friend she knew
and trusted.</p>

<p>After the expenses of the colonel&rsquo;s funeral
were paid and her score settled with Mrs. Seymour,
she had still nearly one thousand dollars
left. This to her represented a little fortune.
Even without work she could live on it for
several years. Economy had been the only
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>completed branch in Viola&rsquo;s education, and in
this she was as proficient as she was ignorant
of all pertaining to business and the investment
or disposal of money. If she could find employment
she would put her money away&mdash;tie
it up in an old glove, and hide it in the bottom
of her trunk. Mrs. Seymour had refused to
allow her to leave until she had positively arranged
for a place of abode which would be
waiting and ready for her. Under the direction
of that sensible woman, Viola had written
and engaged one of Mrs. Cassidy&rsquo;s upper back
rooms&mdash;it being the only place of its kind in
the city where she knew the people.</p>

<p>The evening before her departure the last
leaf was added to this momentous and miserable
Sacramento chapter. Meeting her in the
sitting-room, Bart Nelson had detained her and
made a halting and bashful offer of marriage.
Viola, too stunned by the terrible surprise of
the past week to have room for any more astonishment,
had listened to him indifferently, and
then politely but coldly refused him.</p>

<p>The young man seemed to be astonished.
He looked at her incredulously.</p>

<p>&ldquo;But&mdash;but,&rdquo; he stammered, &ldquo;what are you
going to do?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to San Francisco to-morrow,&rdquo;
she answered, rather wearily, as she knew he
was aware of her purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;But what are you going to do when you
get there?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to work at something.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Work at something! What in the world
can you work at? You look as if you hadn&rsquo;t
strength enough to grind an organ! You must
be crazy.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can work at anything,&rdquo; she said, almost
absently. &ldquo;Besides, I have money to live on,
enough for a long time&mdash;several years.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He looked at her moodily, amazed by her
indifference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;It would be a hundred times better for you
to stay here and marry me. I&rsquo;d take care of
you and support you. Ain&rsquo;t that better for a
woman than scratching along by herself? Mrs.
Seymour says you haven&rsquo;t got a friend in San
Francisco.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No; but I don&rsquo;t mind that. I don&rsquo;t want to
marry. I don&rsquo;t ever want to.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;But isn&rsquo;t it better to have a man to work for
you, and give you a nice comfortable home, and&mdash;well&mdash;of
course, be fond of you, and all that&mdash;than
to go off by yourself, trusting to luck
to get work? You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re
in for.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Perhaps I don&rsquo;t. But truly, there&rsquo;s no use
talking about it any more. I can&rsquo;t. I couldn&rsquo;t,
no matter what happened. It was kind of you
to think of me. Thank you, and good-by.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span></p>

<p>When she had gained her own room she
stood among her scattered possessions, thinking.
No one knew how terrifying her loneliness
seemed to her. As she looked out at it
now, so close at hand, to begin to-morrow, her
heart sickened, and the bleakness of an encompassing
world, all strange, all cold, all uncaring,
seemed to encircle her. Were not protection,
companionship, home, at any price, better than
this? She recalled the young man&rsquo;s coarse but
good-natured face, his passion shining through
the businesslike phlegm of his manner, and
uttered a vehement exclamation, at the same
time making a gesture as though repulsing
him. There were some things that even to a
woman in her position were impossible.</p>

<p>The next day she started, turning her back
on her father&rsquo;s grave, and her face toward the
city where she had been born and yet had not
a friend.</p>

<p>Had Mrs. Cassidy heard this stricture upon
her lonely condition, she would have hotly denied
it. Mrs. Cassidy told Viola that she would
be at once a mother and a father to her, and
Micky Cassidy, her son, would fill the various
positions of male relations that, in Miss Reed&rsquo;s
case, were as yet untenanted. The impulsive
widow did her best to make the girl feel at
home, and certainly offered Viola the consolation
of shedding many tears with her, and of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>lauding the colonel&rsquo;s good qualities till even
the girl&rsquo;s dulled emotions were roused, and she
wept as she had not done since her father&rsquo;s
death.</p>

<p>But her home-coming was sharpened with
pangs that she had not reckoned on when her
first longing to return to the city swept over
her. Every step of her surroundings was reminiscent
of her father and of their close companionship.
All the byways held recollections
of him, of small happenings that, at the time,
had been pregnant with joy or anxiety, of little
jokes they had had together. The shops they
dealt at seemed as if they might at any moment
disgorge his tall, angular figure, with its
quick, decisive step, the old face alight with
smiles as his eye fell on her.</p>

<p>One afternoon, after she had been home a
week, she was returning from a walk, slowly
traversing the familiar streets, absorbed in her
own thoughts. So engrossed was she that, for
the moment, the Sacramento interval, with all
that it had held, was obliterated from her mind,
and, walking loiteringly, she turned the accustomed
corner and approached the house. Her
suspension of memory lasted till she had her
hand on the gate. Then, with a sudden, dizzying
rush, the consciousness of the present
returned. She felt faint and sick, and stood
holding the gate-post and looking up at the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>house with a frightened face. When she had
mastered herself she went home to her room at
Mrs. Cassidy&rsquo;s and locked herself in. Mrs.
Cassidy knocked at her door three times that
evening, but Viola would not open it, even
when the widow, through the keyhole, extolled
the merits of the tea she had waiting on the
tray.</p>

<p>The next day Viola appeared to be herself,
though she looked white and listless, and Mrs.
Cassidy resolved to impart to her a piece of
information that, with great effort of will, she
had been hoarding up to cheer a particularly
dark hour. It was her habit to bring Viola
her tea at six, and during this meal to seat herself
and discourse with her lodger in a friendly
and cheering spirit. The widow loved a gossip,
and it seemed to her that Miss Reed was
a person more redolent of romance than any
one she had ever known before.</p>

<p>Rocking comfortably back and forth in the
plush-covered, ribbon-decked rocking-chair, she
watched her lodger as she poured out her tea,
and delicately, after the manner of people who
are without appetite, broke small fragments off
her roll and put them in her mouth. Then, in a
voice vibrating with secret exultation, she said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You won&rsquo;t always feel so bad as this, honey.
Things cheer up sooner &rsquo;n we expect, and black
clouds have silver linin&rsquo;s. Besides, there&rsquo;s
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>friends of yours that wouldn&rsquo;t let you want
for nothin&rsquo;, if they knew you was back.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She saw the piece of roll stop midway between
Viola&rsquo;s mouth and the plate, and her eyes
fix themselves on the lid of the tea-pot in an
arrested stare.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean?&rdquo; said the girl, the even
modulations of her voice not hiding its undertone
of apprehension.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you suppose?&rdquo; retorted Mrs. Cassidy,
teasingly.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t imagine,&rdquo; replied Viola. &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t
the slightest idea to whom you&rsquo;re referring.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, yes, you have, now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Cassidy,
wagging her head knowingly, and flushing over
her broad, buxom face with the pleasure of her
secret. &ldquo;Try and guess.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Who do you mean, Mrs. Cassidy?&rdquo; said Viola.
Her pretension of indifference had suddenly
disappeared. She tried to make her voice commanding,
but it was full of a frightened distress.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mr. John Gault,&rdquo; announced the other, her
narrow eyes, alight with curiosity, fastened on
her lodger&rsquo;s face. The change in its expression,
quick, inexplicable in its sudden tightening of
the muscles and veiling of the eyes, told the
watcher, not what the romance was that she so
keenly scented, but confirmed her suspicions
that there was a romance of some sort or
other.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span></p>

<p>Viola turned back to the tea-things. As
she moved them about, the eager eyes of the
watcher saw that her hands were trembling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the finest gentleman I ever set eyes
on since I came to California,&rdquo; continued the
widow, immensely interested and hardly able
to wait for further developments. &ldquo;I said to
Micky, after he&rsquo;d been here, &lsquo;There, Mick
Cassidy, is the way they grow real gentlemen.
No imitation about him!&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Was he <i>here</i>?&rdquo; came the question, in a hardly
comprehending voice.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was that&mdash;and to find out about you.
He was that crazy to know where you&rsquo;d gone
that he was at Coggles&rsquo;s, and had the Robsons
turned &rsquo;most inside out with his questions.
When he couldn&rsquo;t get nothing out of them, he
got detectives to track out Mick,&mdash;&rsquo;cause, you
remember, he&rsquo;d left that package,&mdash;and he was
here to find out what I knew. Oh, he&rsquo;s got it
bad.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Viola, conscious of the scrutiny fastened
upon her, bent her face over the tray. She
began to make another cup of tea.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t give him no information,&rdquo; continued
Mrs. Cassidy&mdash;&ldquo;more&rsquo;s the pity, for I
ain&rsquo;t never seen a gentleman that took my fancy
more; and just as pleasant and agreeable as
if he was no better off than me or Mick. Policeman
O&rsquo;Hara, when I asked him, says to me:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>&lsquo;Rich? Why, Mrs. Cassidy, he&rsquo;s more money
in a minute than you&rsquo;ll ever see in your life.
He&rsquo;s a capitalist, and not mean, like the rest of
&rsquo;em, neither.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>Though the widow&rsquo;s tongue had been busy,
her eyes had followed the tea-making closely.
It was not a success. Viola had abandoned it,
and her hands were now clasped under the edge
of the table. But she made no comment, sitting
motionless, with her face averted. Nothing
daunted, Mrs. Cassidy returned to the charge.</p>

<p>&ldquo;He was just dead set upon finding you. He
says to me as he left, says he, &lsquo;If you hear anything
of her, Mrs. Cassidy, let me know. Send
over Mick the first thing in the morning.&rsquo;&rdquo;</p>

<p>It must be confessed that Mrs. Cassidy&rsquo;s
imagination had added this last touch; but to
Viola, in her fluttered alarm, it carried no suggestion
of fiction.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Mrs. Cassidy,&rdquo; she said, turning on the
woman, &ldquo;you haven&rsquo;t let him know? You
haven&rsquo;t sent Mick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Lord love you, no, dear,&rdquo; returned the
widow, good-humoredly. &ldquo;I was waiting till
you pulled yourself together a little more. But
don&rsquo;t you think, now,&rdquo;&mdash;she leaned forward and
spoke in a wheedling tone, but with her eyes
full of an avid interest,&mdash;&ldquo;don&rsquo;t you think you
might write a little letter, and Mick&rsquo;ll take it
over to his office this evening?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span></p>

<p>Viola pushed back from the table, her face
suddenly suffused with an angry red.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;no!&rdquo; she cried violently. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t think
of such a thing&mdash;don&rsquo;t suggest it! I don&rsquo;t
want to see that gentleman again, ever. This
is my affair, Mrs. Cassidy; leave it to me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>She rose from the table and walked to the
window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no use gettin&rsquo; mad about it,&rdquo; retorted
the other, somewhat tartly, rising from
the rocker and setting the tea-things on the
tray. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m only tryin&rsquo; to do the best I can
for you. And it don&rsquo;t seem to me just right
for a girl like you, young and not over-strong,
to be knockin&rsquo; round this way, when she&rsquo;s
got friends ready to black her boots for her.
Still, it&rsquo;s your funeral, not mine.&rdquo;</p>

<p>There was no reply, and as she lifted the
tray she said in an aggrieved tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want to hurt no one&rsquo;s feelin&rsquo;s, but
I want to do my dooty in this world. Well,
good night, deary. Don&rsquo;t get down on your
luck. You&rsquo;re not so friendless as you think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>After she had left the room, Viola stood
motionless, looking out of the window on the
gray and soot-grimed back yard. Night was
falling, and the washing, still pendulating on
its lines after the slovenly fashion of the neighborhood,
gleamed white and ghostly through
the dusk. A high brick wall shut off the end
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>of the lot, and over this, dark, mournful-looking
trails of ivy hung downward, rubbing back
and forth in the passing breaths of wind. It
was a prospect and an hour conducive to melancholy.
But Viola felt none. For the moment
a sense of hunted terror had shut out all
other feelings.</p>

<p>He had searched for her, employed detectives
to try and find a clue to her hiding-place!
And now, led by some horrible caprice of destiny,
she had walked into the very house where
he would soonest find her. She must go to-morrow.
Mrs. Cassidy could not be trusted.
The expression of her face, with its ugly, half-concealed
triumph and its coarsely prying interest,
warned the girl that the secret of her
whereabouts would not long remain with the
widow. In a fever of anxiety she paced up
and down the room. Her nerves, broken by
the shock and strain of the past two weeks,
exaggerated the importance of the situation,
till she felt as if Mrs. Cassidy and Gault had
spread a net around her, from which, in her
weakness, she would never be able to break
away.</p>

<p>She fell asleep, only to wake in the dead of
the night, shaken into throbbing consciousness
by the thought that the widow had already
communicated with Gault, and that the conversation
of that evening was for the purpose
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>of preparing her for the appearance of her lover.
Curled up and trembling under the clothes, she
lay staring into the blackness about her. It
seemed a reflex, in its impenetrable gloom, of her
own surroundings. With the goblin terrors of
night weighing upon her overwrought spirit,
she felt too helpless and feeble to battle with a
life that was so beset with pitfalls. The dreariness
of her isolation, the hopelessness of her
misplaced love, that should have been the
crown of her life, and was instead its direst
dread and peril, seemed combining to crush
her, and in her despair she pressed her face
into the pillow and whispered wild supplications
for death.</p>

<p>The next morning life did not look so formidable.
Things fell into their proper perspective,
and Viola&rsquo;s fears of Mrs. Cassidy as an
agent of destruction appeared phantasmagoric.
Nevertheless, sunlight and its restoring influences
did not allay all her doubts of the woman.
She had seen her thoughts and intentions written
on her face, and she knew that it would
only be a question of time when she would be
tempted to communicate with Gault.</p>

<p>She determined to leave Mrs. Cassidy with no
clue as to her new place of residence. She had
no idea as to where she would go, except that
she would try to find a lodging as far from
where she was now as possible. This would be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>an easy matter. The town seemed to be placarded
from end to end with the signs of &ldquo;Furnished
Rooms.&rdquo; Viola was brave, now the morning
had come, and with it sunlight. Moreover,
the thought of moving from the locality every
corner of which seemed alive with memories
of her father was a sustaining relief.</p>

<p>After breakfast she acquainted Mrs. Cassidy
with her intention of leaving, giving as her
reason the fact that that portion of the city was
too full of painful memories for her to remain
in it. The widow received the news with loud
lamentations, which ended almost in tears. As
soon as she had overcome her surprise and
commanded her feelings, she besieged Viola
with questions as to where she intended going.
The girl, who was not skilful at this sort of
duel, found it difficult to evade her hostess&rsquo;s
vigilant determination to maintain her surveillance.
Viola was soon red and stammering
under the widow&rsquo;s persistent and unescapable
queries, and her discomfort was not lessened by
the realization that Mrs. Cassidy had guessed
her real reason for leaving and had resented
it.</p>

<p>It was a clear, soft morning, the air still and
golden. In its brief Indian summer the city
seemed to stretch itself, and lie warm, apathetic,
and relaxed, basking in the mellowness of its
autumnal quiet. That part of it toward which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>Viola directed her course was almost as old as
the locality where she had passed her uneventful
girlhood. Boarding an electric car, she
crossed the low basin of the town, where originally
the village of Yerba Buena skirted the cove
in straggling huts and tents. Here the business
life of a metropolis is compressed into an
area covered by a few blocks. Women do their
shopping one street away from where men are
making the money which renders the shopping
possible. The car swept Viola through the gay
panorama that Kearney Street presents on a
sunny morning, out past Portsmouth Square,
with a glimpse of Chinese back balconies, where
lines of flowering plants, the dip of swaying
lanterns, and here and there the brilliant spot
of color made by a woman or a child, bring to
the scene a whiff of the Orient.</p>

<p>Beyond, where the broken flank of Telegraph
Hill rises gaunt and red amid its clinging
tenements, she alighted and continued her
way on foot. She made a detour round the
forbidding steeps of the hill, past narrow alleys
where shawled figures slunk along lengths of
sun-touched wall, by old verandahed houses
brooding under rusty cypress-trees, by straight-fronted,
plastered dwellings, the stucco streaked
with dark rain-stains like the traces of tears
on a face too dejected to care how it looked.
Finally the street rose over a spur of the hill,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span>then dipped, sloping down to the hollow of
North Beach.</p>

<p>There was a sudden widening of the horizon
on every side. Marine views broke on the eye
through the spaces between high, cramped, flat
buildings, over the tops of decrepit cottages, in
the breaks between peeling, vine-draped walls.
Vivid bits of sea were set in mosaic-like clearness
between the trunks of dark old trees in
gardens that were planted when the region was
yet suburban. The end of the street&rsquo;s vista
was filled with its blue expanse, with the distant
hills beyond&mdash;all clear lights and shadows
on this sun-steeped autumn morning.</p>

<p>Here was spaciousness and room. The torn
hill, battered and weather-beaten with the
stress and turmoil of the elements, stood up
from the lower portions of the city in an eternal
wash of air fresh from the ocean. Houses
clung to it like barnacles. On its sharper
steeps they seemed to be hanging precariously,
clutching to irregularities in the soil, cowering
down in hollows, or gripping rocky projections.
But on its seaboard face the slope was more
gradual, and here, in the old days, prosperous
families had once built charming villas, where,
from rose-shaded balconies, the inmates could
look on the bay, sometimes a weltering waste,
sometimes a vast sapphire level tracked with
the trails of sailing-vessels bending to the trades.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Viola knew that North Beach, like her old
home, was a quarter upon which fashion had
turned its back. Rents were low there, and,
judging by the number of signs of &ldquo;Furnished
Rooms,&rdquo; the inhabitants must be poor. She
began her search at the foot of the hill, working
up through the streets that struck her
as at once clean and respectable-looking. But
even her humble requirements were hard to
fill.</p>

<p>By noontime, passing back and forth from
street to street, she had gained the top of the
hill. She had seen nothing at once tolerable
to her taste and suitable to her purse. Now,
spent with fatigue and disappointment, she
climbed a last breathless ascent, and came out
upon the slope below the summit. This space
of open ground, devoid of streets, and with
here and there a hovel squalidly sprawling
amid its own debris, slants up the crest of the
incline upon which perches the deserted observatory,
worn and weather-stained into an
appearance of mellow antiquity.</p>

<p>Even at this warm noonday hour the air
was pure and balmily clear. Viola sank down,
panting, on a broken sod, and several dogs,
attracted by the unusual presence of a stranger,
rushed upon her from one of the neighboring
shanties, barking frenziedly. Some hens
joined them, and for a moment they stood in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>an excited group, evidently meditating a sortie.
Presently a tousled woman in a wrapper
emerged from the house and threw an old boot
at them, at which they scattered&mdash;the hens
running off in staggering terror, the dogs
scuttling away to safer regions, their tails
tucked in.</p>

<p>The silence that settled was crystalline. It
seemed to place the city at a curiously remote
distance. Far below her, Viola could see the
wharves and the masts of ships that lay idle by
the quays. Men were running about down there
with the smooth, sure movements of mechanical
toys. Drays passed along the water-front,
and little light wagons that sped by in a sudden
wake of dust. From there, and from regions
unseen, sounds came up to her with clear distinctness.
A bell rang, a dog barked, a child
cried piercingly&mdash;each sound seeming to rise
separate and finely accentuated from the muffled
roar which broods over the hives of men.</p>

<p>She leaned back against the broken ground
behind her and looked sleepily about. The
parched sward was lined by little paths that
seemed to cross and recross each other in purposeless
wanderings. Some led to the edge of
a quarry that had torn away a huge chunk of
the hill as though a giant lion had struck down
and ripped off a piece of its flank. Below her
were the roofs and chimneys of houses on the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>face of the slope. Smoke came from the chimneys
and went up straight, and here and there
the ragged foliage of eucalyptus-trees that had
grown sere and scant in the turmoil of wintry
gales hung motionless, resting on this day of
grace. It must be near midday, Viola thought,
and, even as the thought formed in her mind,
all the whistles of the city below seemed to
suddenly open their throats and blow together&mdash;a
long, mellifluous, fluent sound. Then there
was a pause, and odd ones, late but determined,
took up the cry and poured out their hollow,
reverberant roar. From the water-front louder
ones came, hoarse, harsh, dominant, riding the
tumult like strident talkers, and others, shrill-toned,
broke in, high and protesting, and the
note of distant whistles, away in the Mission
and the Potrero, answered again, faint, thin,
and far. It was twelve o&rsquo;clock.</p>

<p>Viola gathered herself up from her relaxed
attitude. She had been hunting now for two
hours, and felt tired and discouraged. She
wished she could live here, since one must live
somewhere&mdash;just here, she thought, as she
rose stiffly to her feet and dusted her dress.
No one would ever find her, and there was
something at once inspiring and soothing in
all this vast panorama of sea and mountain
and this wash of living air. She looked back
at the house the woman with the shoe had
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span>come from, and wondered if even there they
would take her in. The woman had come to a
doorway now, and stood there, eying her, it
seemed to Viola, with suspicious disfavor; and
even as she looked, the dogs, grown brave
again, made a spirited rally round the corner,
and came yapping about her heels. She
turned and, selecting the first path that she
saw, walked down over the forward face of
the hill.</p>

<p>The fall of the land was so abrupt here that
the few householders had had to build steps
from the street below to their gates. Some
had even gone to the extravagance of a handrail.
Viola, making a chary descent, was attracted
to glance about her by a sweet, pungent
fragrance, and looking to locate its source,
found herself at the gate of a house, low, long,
and narrow, with a garden on the outward
side, terraced to keep the soil from sliding
bodily down into the back yard of the house
below. From this garden rose the scent that
had attracted her. It was the soft, illusive
perfume of mignonette, of which the little inclosure,
sheltered from the winds by a lattice-work
fence, held a goodly store.</p>

<p>The love of flowers was strong in Viola, and
pressing her breast against the top of the fence,
she stood peering in at the garden with its
roughly bordered terraces and pebbled paths.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span>The mignonette was growing in a border that
skirted the side of the house. In the parterres
below it were many varieties of blossoming annuals
and rose-bushes still densely in flower.
The cypress-trees from the yard below showed
their dark, funereal tops over the outer fence,
and a gaunt eucalyptus made a pattern on the
pale noonday sky with its drooping foliage.
From the garden Viola&rsquo;s gaze turned to the
house. It presented its side to the view, its
narrow front to the street. Its seaward face
was flanked by a balcony, and windows, commanding
the enormous sweep of water and distant
hills, were set closely along the wall. In
one of these windows Viola saw the sign her
eyes had grown so accustomed to that morning&mdash;&ldquo;Furnished
Rooms.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Half an hour later she made her exit from the
house, having completed her arrangement to
become a tenant that same day. Its sole occupant
at the time was the landlady, Miss
Defoe, a spinster of advanced years, who dwelt
there with her brother. She was glad of the
chance of a lodger, especially one who seemed
so gently tractable. The almost inaccessible
position of the house made it difficult to rent
the rooms, even at the lowest prices. Viola
found that the terms offered her were more
desirable than those made by Mrs. Cassidy.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, having made her escape
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>from the widow&rsquo;s with guilty stealth, she took
up her residence on the high hilltop, in a room
from one window of which she could look out
through the Golden Gate on the broad bosom
of the Pacific, while from the other she could
see the dappled sweep of the Alameda hills, with
Berkeley and Oakland clustering about their
bases.</p>

<p>A life uneventful and monotonous now began
for the solitary girl. The days in the house on
the hill passed with the even, colorless rapidity
of days full of uninteresting duties and bereft
of the stimulus of hope. Viola plodded on
doggedly, with her head down and her eyes on
the furrow before her. Work had cropped up
quickly, and she turned to it with dull resolution.
In the back of the house some former
tenant had built a small greenhouse, which,
during the Defoes&rsquo; occupancy, had been left in
dusty desuetude. Being granted the use of it,
she cleaned and repaired it, and here once more
plied her old graceful trade of raising plants.</p>

<p>Her friend the Kearney Street florist, to
whom the colonel in his grand days had given
many profitable orders, was glad to help the
daughter of his old patron. Once again Viola
found herself supplying his shops with the delicate
ferns which grew so luxuriantly under her
intelligent care. Besides this, he now and then
engaged her to assist in making up floral pieces
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>used in decoration and at weddings and funerals.
In this branch of the work she displayed so
much taste and skill that her services were
employed more and more constantly.</p>

<p>She earned enough to supply her small
wants, and the remains of the thousand dollars
lay untouched in the bottom of her trunk.</p>

<p>As the winter began, with its early darkening
of the days, its long gray spells of lowering
weather, and its first warm, hesitating rains,
Viola spent hours in the small room behind the
store in Kearney Street, surrounded by flowers
mounted on wire stalks, which she stuck into the
mossy mold that filled in the skeleton frames.
When the work was heavy she was assisted by
the girl who waited in the shop&mdash;a self-confident,
talkative young woman, whom every one
called &ldquo;Miss Gladys,&rdquo; and who had the most
improbably golden hair and the most astonishingly
high collars Viola had ever seen. Nevertheless,
the confidential chatter of Miss Gladys,
which ranged over a variety of topics, not the
least of which was Miss Gladys&rsquo;s own conquering
charm and its fatal power, had a salutary
effect in diverting Viola from her brooding
melancholy.</p>

<p>Her hours in the shop and greenhouse acted
as preservatives of her physical health and mental
freshness. Here she felt safe from observation,
and worked on, with mind engrossed
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>and fingers busy, through the long gray afternoons
till the dark fell and the early night
was spangled with garlands of lamps.</p>

<p>In the off hours, when her plants did not
need her attention and there was no work for
her at the store, she took long walks. That
portion of the city where she had hidden herself
grew as familiar to her as the old one on
the other side of town. Its charm of a ruinous
picturesqueness, of a careless intermingling
of alien races, of a sprawling, slovenly serenity
through days drenched by sun and swept by
rain, was slowly revealed to her. Aspects of
it grew to have expressions of almost human
attraction or repulsion. This little blue glimpse
of sea invited her, with its suggestion of freedom
and space. That lowering alley, dark and
furtive, with reluctant rays of sunshine slanting
down its walls, and the gleam of eyes
watching from behind its stealthy shutters, inspired
her imagination to strange, soaring
flights.</p>

<p>From the summit of the hill she looked down
on the crowding, dun-colored city, cut cleanly
with streets and decked with feathers of smoke,
and tried to reconstruct the village of &rsquo;49.
Here, far back, was the curve of the shore;
there, up the California Street incline, tents
and shanties were dotted through the chaparral;
and below, an open sand-space marked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span>the plaza. The adobe of the SeÃ±ora Briones
lay farther round in the hollow of North Beach;
her father had often shown her where it stood.
Now the myriad roofs of a metropolis stretched
far away, filling the valley and cresting the adjacent
hills. Domes and the crosses on church
steeples caught the light, and from this great
height the girdle of silver water encircled it like
a restraining bond.</p>

<p>The Italian and Spanish quarter was even
more interesting. It was farther round, on one
of the steepest faces of the hill. The streets
seemed to share the characteristics of their occupants.
They all started out bravely from
the level ground, ascended for a few energetic
blocks, then gave up the effort and appeared
to lazily collapse in a debris of unkempt houses
and squalid yards. But no one seemed to care.
A tranquil indifference pervaded the quarter.
Only the old houses&mdash;grave, stucco-fronted
dwellings, with long windows under floriated
cornices, and iron balconies skirting the upper
stories&mdash;had the air of looking out on this
degradation of the once prosperous region with
the sad, patient dignity of a broken old age.
Here and there, too, stood those dwellings,
relics of Spanish taste, which maintain a secret
and arresting suggestion of mystery. They
are ramparted from vulgar eyes by a high
plaster wall, which, through a curved arch<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span>way,
gives egress up a flight of steps. All is
dark, mossy, and quiet. Over the top of the
wall great strands of ivy hang, and only an
angle of windowed roof rises above the sheltering
cypress- and pepper-trees.</p>

<p>But through decay, poverty, and dirt the
love of beauty still spoke. It met Viola&rsquo;s eye
and gave her its message in the touch of green,
in the brilliant blossom that rejoiced in its
existence on balcony-rail and window-ledge.
Flowers were the one ornament that was cheap.
They hung from windows, and stretched out
frail blossoms from shadowed angles. They
grew bushily in glad luxuriance on sunny
roofs, and put forth buds of perfect beauty
behind broken, grimy panes. When the sun
touched them they bloomed, bravely, splendidly,
prodigally, giving forth their best. Old
verandas, sagging under their weight of decrepitude
and household overflow, held their
gardens. In the most menacing of the alleys
there was the gleam of flower and leaf from
starch- and soap-boxes on the ledges below
unwashed, unshuttered casements. Viola had
seen children leaning over the sills as they
searched with pouting, busy gravity for a bud
to pluck; and sometimes she caught a glimpse
of the coarse, painted face of some humble
Aspasia of the quarter bending over her window-garden,
where the flowers bloomed as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>luxuriantly for her as they did for the children
on the floors above.</p>

<p>With the advance of winter and its multiplying
gaieties, Viola&rsquo;s engagements at the florist&rsquo;s
grew more and more frequent, her hours
longer. Her employer realized that she was a
more than ordinarily valuable acquisition, and
constantly demanded the assistance of her skill
and taste. She was often detained till long
after dark, when she made a weary way up the
hill to the cold dinner that had been awaiting
her since six o&rsquo;clock. On one of these nights, at
the beginning of the rainy season, she walked
past her destiny unseeing and unsuspecting.</p>

<p>It had been a lowering day. The clouds lying
low and gray over the city bulged with rain
which did not fall. The wind was moist and
sweet, smelling as if it had blown over miles of
rich earth, quick with germinating seed. People
were out with umbrellas, and the children
as they came home from school were protected
by mackintoshes and rubbers.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p class="no-indent"><span class="smcap">Gault</span>, walking up Kearney Street in the gray
of the late afternoon, observed his sister-in-law&rsquo;s
coupÃ© standing at the curb before a popular
confectioner&rsquo;s. As he approached, Letitia
emerged from the shop, her hands full of small
boxes, and crossed the sidewalk to the carriage.
He encountered her half-way, and
paused with her by the carriage door for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[Pg 255]</a></span>moment&rsquo;s greeting. Gault did not see as much
of his brother&rsquo;s household as formerly. They
knew of Viola Reed&rsquo;s disappearance; and Letitia
from delicacy and Maud from a sense of
guilty embarrassment refrained from urging
him to reÃ«stablish himself on the old footing of
careless intimacy.</p>

<p>He said now, in response to Letitia&rsquo;s query
why he absented himself so much, that he was
getting old and had to go to bed early. &ldquo;For
beauty sleep, you know,&rdquo; he added, looking at
her with his eyes smiling behind his glasses.
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t need that, do you, Tishy? Hullo,
there&rsquo;s the rain!&rdquo;</p>

<p>The first drops, swollen, slow, and reluctant,
spotted the pavement. The air felt curiously
damp, and had a languid softness in its
touch.</p>

<p>Letitia looked up at the low-hanging clouds,
and a drop fell on her cheek.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, there it is,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Get in the
carriage and come home to dinner, John. No
one will be there&mdash;just ourselves.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He said he had an engagement for dinner.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, then, get in the carriage and drive
with me down to South Park, where I have a
message to give a scrub-woman. I&rsquo;ve got
something I want to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He obediently entered, and the coachman
turned the horses&rsquo; heads in the direction of
South Park.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span></p>

<p>The afternoon had suddenly darkened as if a
pall had been unfurled across the sky. The
streets without had burst into a forest of umbrellas,
already shining, and agitated with
curiously unsteady movements as the bearers
hurried this way and that. The rain was still
falling slowly, but the drops were large. A
little flurry of wind lashed the window with
them as the coupÃ© made its way through the
mÃªlÃ©e of vehicles and over the car-tracks at
Lotta&rsquo;s Fountain. An eery, yellowish light
seemed to be diffusing itself from the horizon,
and to have crept along under the dark cope of
the storm.</p>

<p>Letitia leaned forward, looking out at the
figures of the passers-by, butting against the
wind with lowered umbrellas, and then jerking
them aside and giving a scared look up and
down for a threatening car. Gault, leaning
back, could see her profile clearly defined
against the pale square of the window. On the
little seat in front of them she had dropped
all her parcels, and a bunch of violets that she
had thrust into a convenience for that purpose
filled the carriage with its soft and subtle
fragrance. Outside, the bells of the cars
clanged furiously, and at moments the rain
was dashed against the window and then
diverted.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, Tishy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;what&rsquo;s the com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>munication
you&rsquo;re going to make? As far as
I know, when a lady speaks solemnly of having
an important matter to impart, it only means
one thing.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s that?&rdquo; asked Letitia, without responding
to the raillery of his tone.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That she is going to be married.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, that&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; she answered, and
continued to look out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;What?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault leaned forward and tried to see what
her face revealed. It was handsome as ever,
calm and imperturbable.</p>

<p>&ldquo;That&rsquo;s just it,&rdquo; she repeated, turning toward
him and letting her eyes dwell gravely
on his. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s what I wanted to talk to you
about.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tishy!&rdquo; he ejaculated. &ldquo;Why, you amaze
me!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why should I?&rdquo; she queried. &ldquo;Everybody
gets married sometime or other.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I know, but&mdash;who is it?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Tod McCormick.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, Letitia!&rdquo; he exclaimed in quite a different
tone&mdash;a man&rsquo;s tone of sudden revolt and
protest. &ldquo;Tod McCormick?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, of course, Tod McCormick. I should
think you would have guessed him in a minute.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;He&rsquo;s the last person I ever should have
thought of.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, isn&rsquo;t that odd! Everybody knows
Tod&rsquo;s been fond of me. It&rsquo;s been going on for
years&mdash;five or six, I should think.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A woman doesn&rsquo;t marry a man because he
happens to be fond of her. She marries a man
because she happens to be fond of him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;She sometimes does&mdash;if she&rsquo;s very lucky,
and things turn out exactly right. But things
don&rsquo;t often turn out exactly right. Besides, I
like Tod.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes&mdash;like him, of course. Everybody likes
him. Maud likes him, and Mortimer, and, I&rsquo;ve
no doubt, hundreds of other people. But liking&rsquo;s
a poor sort of thing to marry on. It&rsquo;s a
bad substitute for love. A woman ought to
love the man she marries.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes, I suppose she ought; and in novels
she always does&mdash;unless she hates him terribly.
But in real life girls don&rsquo;t love or hate so desperately
as all that. We just go along easily,
taking things as they come.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are you going to marry him, if you
don&rsquo;t love him?&rdquo; he asked in a tone of irritation.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I think it&rsquo;s better to marry. You see, there
isn&rsquo;t really anything else for a girl like me to
do. Besides,&mdash;don&rsquo;t misunderstand me,&mdash;I tell
you I like him very much.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He ignored the remark and said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see what you want to marry for at
all. Wait till the right man comes along.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, the right man!&rdquo; she answered, with a
little laugh which was the nearest approach to
a bitter laugh he had ever heard from her.
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s what they keep telling us. But
we may have met the right man, and he&rsquo;s
never found out that he was the right man,
or perhaps hasn&rsquo;t felt that we were the right
woman.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;A man must be a fool if he can&rsquo;t see when
a woman cares for him,&rdquo; he answered.</p>

<p>For a moment Letitia looked silently out of
the window; then she continued, but without
turning her head: &ldquo;Men seem to think that
women can marry any one they want. We
have to wait till we&rsquo;re asked. And the men
that ask us are not always the men that we
would like the best. Novelists would make
you think a girl has nothing to do but make
her choice from dozens of suitors who are all
crazy about her. But that&rsquo;s not true&mdash;not in
California, anyway. I&rsquo;ve only had three real
offers in my life, and I&rsquo;ve got money, and&rdquo;&mdash;she
made a little pause, and then added bravely&mdash;&ldquo;and
I&rsquo;m handsome.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault leaned forward, and, in a sudden Ã©lan of
admiration for the honest, simple, strong-hearted
creature, took her hand.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dearest Tishy,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t do this.
Don&rsquo;t make a hasty marriage with a man who
is&mdash;who is&mdash;not worthy of you.&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span></p>

<p>Her hand remained motionless for a moment,
and then she drew it away.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t say that. Tod&rsquo;s quite worthy of me,&rdquo;
she answered. &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a first-rate fellow, but
you never liked him, and so you never appreciated
his good points. He&rsquo;s not good-looking,
and that&rsquo;s made people misunderstand him.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault smothered a groan, and she went on:</p>

<p>&ldquo;You asked me why I wanted to marry at
all. There&rsquo;s nothing else for a woman in my
position to do. I&rsquo;m not bright. I can&rsquo;t do
anything like writing, or painting, or making
statues. All I do now is to help Maud when
she has dinners, and talk to the dull people.
And you know&rdquo;&mdash;her voice dropping to a key
of naÃ¯ve confidence&mdash;&ldquo;I sometimes feel that
I&rsquo;d like to have a home of my own&mdash;a house
where I could do just what I liked, and have
the sort of people I liked to dinner. Maud
doesn&rsquo;t care for the kind of people I do.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t you have it, then? You&rsquo;re of
age; you&rsquo;re financially independent. You
can do exactly what you like. You seem to
forget that this is the United States at the end
of the nineteenth century.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t forget; but that doesn&rsquo;t make
it any easier for me. I can&rsquo;t go off and live all
by myself. And think what a fuss Mortimer
and Maud would make! It would drive Maud
crazy if I did that. People would say I&rsquo;d
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>quarreled with her, and she can&rsquo;t stand people
saying things like that. I don&rsquo;t like it, either.
And it would hurt Mortimer&rsquo;s feelings dreadfully.
He&rsquo;d think I wasn&rsquo;t happy with them.
You couldn&rsquo;t make him understand. Besides,
I don&rsquo;t want to live in a house of my
own all alone. I&rsquo;d die of the blues. Think
how dismal I&rsquo;d be with nobody but servants
and Chinamen!&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault looked out of the window near him
and made no immediate response. The appearance
of squalor which marked the street
was intensified by the rain, which was now
falling heavily. Already the pavements shone
with the greasiness of well-tramped mud.
Miserable pedestrians, without umbrellas and
in scanty clothes, stood under the dripping
projections before show-windows, looking out
with yellow, dejected faces. Others plodded
drearily onward, their heads lowered against
the descending flood. Women passed, with
bare, red hands gripping at their sodden skirts.
In the depths of the dark interiors Gault had
seen so often, lights were being kindled that
shone like small red sparks in the thick, smothering
gloom. Without turning from the window,
he said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;But why marry Tod? If you want liberty,
a larger and more independent life, why not
choose some one else?&rdquo;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Letitia was silent for a moment. Then she
said in rather an offended tone:</p>

<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s nothing so dreadful about Tod. I
don&rsquo;t like the way you speak about him. It
sounds as if he was idiotic or deformed. I
like him more than I do almost any one. I respect
him, too. And then,&rdquo; she added, in one
of her uncontrollable bursts of candor, &ldquo;there&rsquo;s
nobody else wants to marry me.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Gault gave an annoyed ejaculation. The
carriage turned from the main thoroughfare
and began jolting over the cobbles of a paved
street.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Then wait till somebody better does,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;Heavens, Letitia! to think of you, that
I&rsquo;ve always looked upon as a model of reason
and sense and intelligence, throwing yourself
away like this, when five-ten years from
now will be time enough for you to marry.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll be twenty-seven next month,&rdquo; replied
Letitia, with her ruthless regard for veracity.</p>

<p>The carriage here stopped at a high-stooped
porch, and the coachman, alighting, delivered
Letitia&rsquo;s message. While they waited, silence
rested between its occupants, and continued
when they were once more rattling over the
uneven cobbles toward the wider street they
had recently left.</p>

<p>Darkness had settled by this time, and the
lamps were breaking out in every direction,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>the long lines of the rain looking like threads
of glass against their light. The force of the
storm was augmenting. The drops beat on
the top of the carriage with a drumming, pugnacious
violence, and now and then dashed
across the window. There were already pools
in the hollows of the pavement, and from bent
gutter-pipes long ribbons of water, torn by the
gusts, sprang down on unwary passers-by.</p>

<p>Letitia took her handkerchief and rubbed
away the moisture on the pane. She was looking
out on the spectacle of the swimming streets
with apparent interest. The conversation had
not been resumed. She had nothing more to
say, and Gault sat back in his corner immersed
in silent thought. Once he had asked her if
her engagement to Tod was a fully accomplished
and recognized fact. To this she had
replied that it was not, exactly, as Tod was to
receive her final answer on the following Sunday,
but that as far as she was concerned it
was a settled thing.</p>

<p>Leaning back in the darkened corner, Gault
bitterly inveighed against the social system
which allows such a mismating; against the
narrowing laws of conventionality which had
fettered so strong a spirit as Letitia; above all,
against that weakness of the woman which
makes life alone so impossible to her unsufficing
and dependent spirit. What a fate for this
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>creature, so rich and tender in her splendid
womanhood! Letitia to make such a marriage&mdash;Letitia,
whom nature had designed to
be some strong man&rsquo;s guide and solace, to be
the queen of a gracious home, the mother of
tall sons and blooming daughters! It was a
sacrilege.</p>

<p>The carriage rolled out upon Market Street,
amid a din of car-bells and the roar of intersecting
streams of traffic. The outlines of the
high newspaper buildings were hazy in the
blur of the rain, but their illuminated windows
seemed dotting the sky far up toward the
zenith, where they burst into a splutter of
lights. From every point cars seemed to be
advancing, with their lanterns shooting rays
through the wet, and stretches of pavement and
pools of water gave forth sudden gleams. The
whole scene, lights magnified and outlines erased
by the rain, had a chaotic, broken effect of glaring
radiance and softly dark, looming vagueness.</p>

<p>Letitia again rubbed the window and leaned
forward. Her companion could see the outline
of her head against the light, as if it were
a silhouette backgrounded with gold-leaf. Why
should he not marry her? Would he not be a
better mate for her than the witless and sickly
boy to whom she intended binding her blooming
youth, for whom she would pour out the
treasures of her heart and reveal the sacred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>places of a nature that he could never understand
or appreciate?</p>

<p>She did not care for Tod. Her very assertions
of a liking for him seemed to the man of
the world proof of her indifference. He could
make her care for him. He was certain of it.
He was certain that even now she had more
real affection for him&mdash;far removed from love
though it was&mdash;than she had for the brainless
lad who next Sunday would be her acknowledged
fiancÃ©.</p>

<p>What was the use of wasting a life in regrets
for what was past, for what was irrevocably
gone? Alone, he would go drearily on, forever
dreaming of his lost paradise. He was so
wretched in the isolation of his own accusing
loneliness! Life was slipping by him unlived.
The future loomed dark and terrible, bereft of
hope and promise. He cowered before its vast,
cold emptiness. There was nothing that offered
him a refuge from its enveloping despair
but an affection in which he could forget the
might-have-beens that now were unforgettable.
The dreariness of that long road would only be
beguiled by a loved presence at his side, a soft
hand in his. And he would make Letitia
happy&mdash;a thousand times happier than she
would be with Tod.</p>

<p>His thoughts reached an abrupt decision.
He leaned forward.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Letitia,&rdquo; he said, in a tone the low pitch
of which did not conceal a peremptory note.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered rather listlessly, without
turning from the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have something to say to you.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Is it that you&rsquo;re going to be married,
too?&rdquo; she asked, smiling.</p>

<p>&ldquo;No&mdash;at least, I don&rsquo;t know. Listen to me.
I want&mdash;&rdquo;</p>

<p>She checked him with a sudden cry, and
leaned forward, staring out of the window.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Oh, John&mdash;wait! That girl! Did you see
her? I&rsquo;m almost sure it was Viola Reed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>In an instant every thought of Letitia had
vanished from his mind.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Where?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;What girl? Which way
did she go?&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Look out of the back window,&rdquo; said Letitia,
greatly excited. &ldquo;Do you see her? A woman
in black, walking quickly. I just caught a
glimpse of her side face as she moved her umbrella,
and it looked very like.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Through the small back window Gault saw
the woman&mdash;a slender figure in black, the head
bent forward under the fronting shield of her
umbrella. As she passed a lamp he saw the
gleam of blond hair. She was walking so rapidly
that already she was some distance away.
He pulled the strap, and the carriage came to a
jolting halt.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Letitia,&rdquo; he said, turning toward her and
trying to speak quietly, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ll excuse me,
won&rsquo;t you? I&rsquo;m going to get out. Yes, I&rsquo;m
going to follow her&mdash;I must. I don&rsquo;t know
whether it&rsquo;s she or not, but it may be. Good
night.&rdquo;</p>

<p>He was out and the door shut before Letitia
could answer. As the carriage rolled
on she turned and through the window followed
his pursuing figure with eagerly interested
eyes.</p>

<p>It was Viola. At the end of the block she
turned into the florist&rsquo;s, where she had agreed
to come and spend the evening helping Miss
Gladys on some extra orders. She passed
through the store into the room beyond, and,
donning her black apron, was soon busy. The
two girls were working and talking together
when Gault stopped at the street door and
swept the flower-scented interior with a searching
gaze. He had done this at every shop on
the block. Yet, though he went up and down,
hunting in every corner, in every darkened
doorway where she might possibly have sought
shelter, she had disappeared as completely as
if the passing glimpse of her had been a
vision.</p>

<p>Letitia had evidently made a mistake.
Slowly through the rain Gault walked home
to his rooms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span></p>

<p>It was two hours later when Viola started to
leave the florist&rsquo;s. The storm was raging with
all the malignant intensity of driving rain and
a wind that lay in wait at corners and sprang
upon the wayfarer. She made part of her journey
on the electric car, but the long climb up
the hill had to be accomplished on foot. About
this high point the wind met few obstacles, and
swept by, shouting hoarsely in the joy of its
freedom.</p>

<p>It played with Viola like a cat with a mouse&mdash;at
one moment swept her forward in a sail-like
spread of skirt, at the next turned upon her,
buffeting her furiously back against the streaming
walls, tearing at her hat, driving the rain
into her face, down her neck, up her sleeves.
It seized her umbrella and whisked it this way
and that, while she held its handle and helplessly
followed its eccentric course. When half-way
up the hill she was forced to shut it, and
then, angry with her for thus terminating its
sport, the wind concentrated its spiteful anger
upon her.</p>

<p>It blew steadily in her face, except at the moments
when she crossed an intersecting street.
Then it seemed to blow from all points at once,
seizing her and shaking her, whirling her about,
throwing her against a gate or into the drenched,
yielding leafage of a hedge, and then creeping
up behind her and beating against her with a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>force that almost sent her on her face. Her
clothes clung to her, saturated and heavy, confining
her limbs with their clammy hold. The
water streamed off her hat and oozed out of her
shoes. Once she was forced to take shelter on
a door-step, under the jutting roof of a balcony.
From this she crept onward, clinging close to
the walls, down which water ran in wide rills,
and where long strands of creepers struck her
with their wet leaves. Once in the cottage, she
threw her clothes out of the window on the
balcony, and crept shivering to bed.</p>

<p>The storm wore itself away in the course of
the week, to be followed by an interval of
bright weather, and then by other storms.
There were short ones, when the rain came
and went with a sudden rolling up of clouds
and breaks of blue, and the sun burst out
hopefully and licked up the moisture. There
were long ones, when the rain fell in warm,
rustling floods, copious but gentle, that
assuaged the earth&rsquo;s thirst and poured down
in silvery lances from a low, swollen sky. There
were blustering ones, that lashed the windows
and threshed against the pavements, flooded
the sewers, and tried to force an entrance
through opened casements and doors left ajar.
And then the great, conscientious, businesslike
ones, which went on day after day, oblivious of
anything but their duty to thoroughly saturate
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span>the dry ground far down through its parched
crust to where the seeds lay waiting for the
moisture that was to give them life.</p>

<p>So the time wore on till Christmas began to
loom close at hand, and all the town was agog
with its holiday shopping.</p>

<p>Maud Gault and Letitia splashed about the
dripping streets in a hired coupÃ©, which returned
from every trip full of packages. Mortimer
went alone to Shreve&rsquo;s and bought his wife and
sister-in-law costly surprises. John ordered his
presents,&mdash;there were a good many of them,&mdash;all
but the beautiful turquoise clasp for Letitia,
which he selected himself. Tod gave his mother
money to buy his sisters suitable gifts, but took
with him a friend of acknowledged taste when
he went to choose the necklet of small diamonds
and emeralds that was to carry his greetings to
the fortunate Miss Mason.</p>

<p>On Christmas eve Mr. and Mrs. Mortimer
Gault gave a large dinner for their sister,
whose engagement to Mr. Theodore McCormick
had been announced a short time before.
Society had often predicted this finale to the
attachment which it was known Mr. Theodore
McCormick had long cherished for Miss Mason.
Society did not concern itself about Miss Mason&rsquo;s
sentiments on the subject. That Mr.
Theodore McCormick was the only son of Jerry
McCormick, one of the richest of the bonanza
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>men, was supposed to be sufficient ground for
Miss Mason to have been pleased and flattered
by his choice of herself. Society regarded her
as a very lucky girl.</p>

<p>John Gault had gone to this dinner reluctantly.
The thought of Letitia&rsquo;s marriage with
Tod was as repulsive to him after a month had
familiarized his mind with it, as it had been
on the day Letitia told him of it. That the
large-hearted girl, whose simple honesty of
nature he had learned long ago to respect and
rely on, was to give the freshness and beauty
of her life to the feeble and half-bred son of a
day-laborer, seemed to him a sacrilege worthy
of the days of Molech. He had seen little
of Letitia lately. When he had been at his
brother&rsquo;s she had generally been absent, staying
at the McCormicks&rsquo;, or dining elsewhere
with Tod. Whatever her feelings for her
fiancÃ© were, Gault saw that, with her unswerving
obedience to convention and duty, she was
evidently doing her best to understand and
grow fond of him.</p>

<p>To-night, however, at the dinner, he saw
that a change had taken place in her. It was
so subtle, so illusive, so hard to define, that for
a space he watched her surreptitiously, wondering
what it was. Yet even as he shook
hands with her in the moment of greeting, he
saw it in her face, he felt it radiating from her,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>like the warm individual atmosphere that is
said to encompass us and contain the color of
our personality.</p>

<p>Her eyes dwelt on his with a bright, soft
inner look of happiness, but happiness aloof
and far away from him. The impersonal, cold
sweetness of her glance seemed to put him at
a great distance, to herd him together with all
the hundred other casual people that she knew
and spoke to, and liked and forgot. Some
mysterious influence had suddenly withered
their friendship. Its richness and reality were
gone, and as he met that sparkling, conscious,
and yet distant glance, he realized that Letitia
was no longer his friend, nor yet his enemy,
but from henceforth would be the same Letitia
to him that she was to his brother, that she
had once been to Tod.</p>

<p>She was in love with Tod McCormick. It
was incredible, inconceivable, but true. He
saw it in the abashed and yet proud consciousness
of her manner to him, in her averted eye,
in the indefinable softening of her whole presence
when the meager-visaged lad addressed
her. Inside she glowed with the consciousness
of the developing of her life; but her eyes only
let a little of the inner light out in their shy
shining. That was why they had lost their
look of a dear, comfortable intimacy when they
met his. Now they said that all that was over,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>a remnant of freedom that must die with
girlhood and its other relinquished liberties.
Everything belonged to some one else now&mdash;not
love alone, but interest, loyalty, confidence,
duty. The rest of the world was only to get
that cool interest, that gentle, remote kindness,
which is the husk of the woman&rsquo;s heart. The
kernel was for her mate. With her maidenhood
would end for Letitia all life but such as bore
on the life of her husband.</p>

<p>Gault had lost her, even as he had lost Viola.
He had thought of marriage removing her from
the close, interested friendliness of the old days,
but he had never realized that it would wean
her from him with this cold completeness. She
wore the semblance of the Letitia of the past,
with strange, bright, alien eyes, and a soft hand
that held his with the slack, indifferent clasp of
polite acquaintance. Women&mdash;would he ever
understand them? Would any man? What
mystery was behind their white foreheads and
under their white breasts?</p>

<p>A rush of unutterable sadness, of dreary, sick
depression, overwhelmed him. He was hardly
able to respond intelligently to the conversational
inanities of Pearl, who sat beside him.
A numbing consciousness of the futility and
hopelessness of life invaded him, and with it, in
the midst of the noise and glitter of the brilliant
scene, a sense of isolation and a yearning
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>for the woman who, in this gay throng, would
have felt lonely as he, and have turned to him
as her one soul-mate. Suppose to-night she
had been waiting for him in the bare parlor
down near South Park!</p>

<p>A sudden resolve seized upon him. As soon
as dinner was over he excused himself to Mrs.
Gault and Letitia, hurried on his overcoat, and
slipped away.</p>

<p>It had been raining all day&mdash;the warm, abundant
rain of late December. The breath of the
night was softly damp, and fragrant with scents
from the saturated gardens. The avenue was
deserted and noiseless, save for the even rustle
of the falling flood, which made the asphalt
shine like ice, into which the lamps&rsquo; reflections
stabbed in long, broken poniards. Nobody was
abroad. It was Christmas eve. There were
wreaths in the lighted windows, and sounds
of singing now and then fell upon Gault&rsquo;s
ear.</p>

<p>He boarded the car which crossed the avenue
farther down, and sat in the glare of its lamps,
his face fallen into lines of spiritless apathy.
When it reached its terminus he alighted.</p>

<p>There were life and movement enough here.
People were jostling on the sloppy sidewalks;
umbrellas struck against umbrellas, sometimes,
in an elbow-brushing contact, caught
together, and were dragged apart with a spatter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[Pg 275]</a></span>ing
of moisture over laughing faces. The rain
dripped monotonously down on them, between
them, across the glare of windows, over the
rheumy halo of lamps, off the cope of cornices
and the angles of gutters. The even roar of
Market Street was broken into by the deep
voices of hilarious men and the shrill notes of
women. Raucous laughter was interrupted by
the sudden petulant wail of tired children. Over
all the light of show-windows poured in a steady
glare, unsoftened by the veil of rain. It was
reflected from innumerable wet surfaces, uncovered
faces that were moist, draperies beaded
with drops, bits of sidewalk, pools in little hollows,
and the black and gleaming bosses of hundreds
of umbrellas.</p>

<p>Gault, unheeded and unheeding, hurried
through the press, crossed Market Street, and
plunged into the region beyond. There were
crowds here too, and lights and laughter, brilliant
windows that sent gushes of raw radiance
across the sidewalks, and Christmas shoppers
as busy as those on the other side of the city&rsquo;s
great dividing artery. Even in the old street,
among the brooding palaces, there was a faint
show of life. In one there were lights in the
second-story windows. Against the ground-glass
panels in the massive front door of another
the circular forms of two wreaths were outlined.
The iron gate of its bulky neighbor grated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>grudgingly to give egress to an expressman
carrying parcels.</p>

<p>In the smaller streets down which he had so
often passed, the windows were alight and, according
to the gracious custom of the time, the
blinds were undrawn. Sometimes he had a
glimpse of darkling interiors, where, alone and
glittering frostily in its fairy trimmings, the
tree stood, not to be revealed until the morrow.
But in many homes they were keeping Christmas
eve. The rifled branches, sparkling even
in their despoilment, were a-wink with candles.
The children clustered about, some flushed
and excited, others sitting solemnly among their
presents, examining them with grave and pouting
intentness. There were mothers with sleeping
babies in their arms, and fathers explaining
the mechanism of wondrous, uncomprehended
toys. They were the city&rsquo;s humblest and least
prosperous homes; yet, hidden by the veil of
night, a man, rich in all they lacked, stood
staring in at them, wistful, heart-hungry, and
envious.</p>

<p>He turned the last corner, and the small
shape of the colonel&rsquo;s old house defined itself
among the surrounding buildings. In the
kindly dark it looked as it used to, and he approached
slowly, letting his gaze wander over
its faÃ§ade and dwell on the homely bulge of the
bay-window, whence, as of old, light broke in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>cracks and splinters on the small panes of glass
on either side of the front door, on the steps,
and the porch that used to sag down to one side,
and the gate between its squat brick posts.</p>

<p>There was no one on the street, but a block
away he could hear the measured tread of Policeman
O&rsquo;Hara on his customary beat from the
saloon at the corner to the saloon in the middle
of the block. Beyond this there was nothing
but the whispering fall of the rain and its warm
breath. Then, as he drew nearer, he passed
into an atmosphere of delicate, illusive sweetness
that told him the jasmine-tree by the
gate was in flower. It recalled vividly other
times when he had come&mdash;but not to stand
outside this way, a stranger in the rain.</p>

<p>He advanced slowly. The street was deserted;
no one was there to spy upon him. What would
he have felt if to-night he had known she was
there, and he was coming to see her&mdash;coming like
a lover to see her, when the door opened to feel
her little hand cold in his, and her lips softly
respond to his welcoming kiss&mdash;the kiss that
had never been given, that was never now to be
returned! He would not pass by, but would
stop at the gate just for a moment, and dream
that she was waiting. He paused, and then
started with a suppressed exclamation.</p>

<p>Some one was standing close in front of him
in the shadow of the jasmine-tree, and almost
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>concealed by its foliage. He could not see
whether the figure was that of a man or woman,
could only trace the outline of a form through
the darkness and rain. Whoever it was, he had
not been heard,&mdash;the fall of the rain muffling
other sounds,&mdash;and he was now close at hand.
As he stood, undecided whether to pass on or
turn back, the figure made a stealthy movement
with its arm&mdash;appeared to part the flexible
jasmine branches and through the aperture
look at the house. The head was thus presented
to Gault in partial profile, spotted over
with the moving lights that filtered between
the leaves. He saw it was a woman&rsquo;s, crowned
with some sort of small, close hat. She seemed
to be watching the house. The light caught
the curve of her cheek; it was gleaming with
moisture.</p>

<p>&ldquo;She must be soaking,&rdquo; he thought, &ldquo;with
no umbrella,&rdquo; and made a step forward.</p>

<p>She heard and started, and, still mechanically
holding the branches back, turned and looked
at him. For one moment, like a memory from
another life, he saw her face in the light.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Viola!&rdquo; he cried, as a man might cry to
whom the beloved dead stood suddenly revealed.</p>

<p>She gave a gasping ejaculation and let go the
branches. In the sudden blotting out of the
light he lost her, and, in his terror and superstitious
dread, he thought he had seen a vision.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>&ldquo;Viola,&rdquo; he cried again, &ldquo;stay with me!
love me! forgive me! I&rsquo;ve prayed for you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve
longed for you&mdash;I&rsquo;ve died for you!
Don&rsquo;t leave me now! There is no life for me
without you!&rdquo;</p>

<p>She came forward beyond the dark shadow
of the tree, and the light shone full on her. He
might still have thought her a vision, for her
face was transfigured with a look that seemed
hardly of this earth. But the woman that he
held in his arms was warm with life, the lips
against his gave back his kiss.</p>

<p>A few moments later Policeman O&rsquo;Hara, having
extended his beat beyond the saloons, saw
what he supposed to be a single figure standing
opposite Robson&rsquo;s house under a dripping umbrella.
As he approached, it suddenly resolved
itself into two figures, and walked away from
him under the umbrella.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll be jiggered!&rdquo; murmured the bewildered
policeman. &ldquo;Have I got it that bad
so early in the evenin&rsquo;?&rdquo;</p>

<p>And judging that his case was gone too far
for help, he dropped into another saloon.</p>

<p>The two figures under the one umbrella walked
down the street, out and away through the rain,
seeing nothing but the vistas of glory which
open before those who for one moment stand
upon the pinnacle of life.</p>
